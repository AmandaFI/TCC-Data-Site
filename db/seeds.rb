# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: "Star Wars" }, { name: "Lord of the Rings" }])
#   Character.create(name: "Luke", movie: movies.first)

# labels = ['H', 'G']
# origin_site = ['BBC', 'TechCrunch', 'TheVerge']

# puts 'Generating news...'
# news = 20.times.map do |i|
#   NewsArticle.create!(
#     content: Faker::Lorem.sentence(word_count: 500),
#     label: labels.sample
