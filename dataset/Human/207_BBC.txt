Donald Trump's social-media platform, Truth Social, has launched, in a limited form, on the US Apple App Store. The app had similarities to Twitter, commentators noted - Mr Trump was banned from Twitter, Facebook and YouTube last year. And some early users had difficulties registering accounts. Project lead and former congressman Devin Nunes said it was expected to be fully operational by the end of March.  Some of those trying to register had been told: "Due to massive demand, we have placed you on our waitlist," the Reuters news agency reported. Created by the year-old Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG), Truth Social had previously been made available to about 500 beta testers. Last week, Donald Trump Jr shared a screenshot of his father's first "truth" on the social network: "Get ready. Your favourite president will see you soon."
