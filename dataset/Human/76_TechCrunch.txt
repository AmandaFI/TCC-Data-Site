Each week listeners can tune into Found to get the real stories behind today’s startups. And while that isn’t changing any time soon, this week I’m excited to bring you something a little extra. I’m pleased to announce that Found has been nominated for a viewer’s choice Webby Award in the Best Technology Podcast category. If you love listening to Found you can help us out by voting for your favorite podcast here. Voting is open until April 20. Building a startup is hard in any market and there is no right way to do it. You can rely on Found to get the real stories behind the startups and hear from entrepreneurs about how they’ve grown their companies and the choices they’ve made along the way.Recently, we’ve had an awesome lineup of startups on the show, from Swedish fintech giant Klarna, to the company looking to bring the wooly mammoth back to life, to a woman-founded perfume company that just launched its first products — and everything in between.We really appreciate you tuning in each week and hope you’ll be able to help us out a little in return by casting your Webby vote for Found by April 20.
