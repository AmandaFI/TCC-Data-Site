San Francisco police officers were faced with a new challenge after stopping an autonomous vehicle with no-one inside. Officers approached the car, operated by Cruise, because it had been driving without headlights. In the incident, captured on film, an officer remarks that there "ain't nobody in it" before the car moves to what Cruise said was a safer location. The company said the headlights issue was a result of human error. Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

Cruise, which is owned by General Motors and develops self-driving technology, has been testing autonomous vehicles (AVs) in the US.  Earlier this year it started allowing members of the public who join a waiting list to hail free night-time rides. Cruise tweeted: "Our AV yielded to the police vehicle, then pulled over to the nearest safe location, as intended. An officer contacted Cruise personnel and no citation was issued."
