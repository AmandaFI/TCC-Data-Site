BuzzFeed News, the Pulitzer Prize-winning news arm of BuzzFeed.com, is being shut down, BuzzFeed CEO Jonah Peretti announced to staff on Thursday. The shutdown is happening as part of a new wave of layoffs at the company that will reduce the company’s workforce by about 15 percent. “While layoffs are occurring across nearly every division, we’ve determined that the company can no longer continue to fund BuzzFeed News as a standalone organization,” Peretti wrote in a memo to staff the company shared with The Verge. Peretti said they would focus on HuffPost, which it acquired in 2020, as the company’s news brand because the publication is “profitable with a loyal direct front page audience.” Both HuffPost and BuzzFeed plan to open “a number of select roles” for BuzzFeed News staffers.  Peretti said that he “made the decision to overinvest” in BuzzFeed News because he loved its work and mission. “This made me slow to accept that the big platforms wouldn’t provide the distribution or financial support required to support premium, free journalism purpose-built for social media.” The publication won a Pulitzer Prize in 2021 for its coverage of China’s detention of hundreds of thousands of Muslims. As for why BuzzFeed is making these changes, “we’ve faced more challenges than I can count in the past few years: a pandemic, a fading SPAC market that yielded less capital, a tech recession, a tough economy, a declining stock market, a decelerating digital advertising market and ongoing audience and platform shifts,” Peretti said. “Dealing with all of these obstacles at once is part of why we’ve needed to make the difficult decisions to eliminate more jobs and reduce spending.” You can read Peretti’s full memo at the end of this article. BuzzFeed has been struggling for some time as a result of platform changes, and you can read about the company’s recent struggles in this excellent article from my colleague Mia Sato. The company has also been experimenting with AI-generated articles, including quizzes and travel guides. It laid off 12 percent of its staff in December.
