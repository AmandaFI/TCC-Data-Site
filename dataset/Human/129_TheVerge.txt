Apple’s long-rumored VR / AR headset might run adapted versions of iPad apps, according to a new report from Bloomberg. The mixed reality device’s new interface will also apparently let users access “millions” of already-available apps on the App Store. This, in my opinion, is very good news: a bunch of great apps could go a long way in making a compelling case for what’s expected to be a very expensive gadget in a device category that isn’t doing great right now. Here are some of the apps you can expect, according to Bloomberg: And the headset’s apps might not be the only thing that might remind you of the iPad; the Home Screen and Control Center will apparently look like the iPad’s as well, Bloomberg says. Apple is expected to finally announce the headset at this year’s Worldwide Developers Conference, which kicks off on June 5th. The device will reportedly cost around $3,000, but it could be a monster device, with rumored features like advanced hand tracking, iris scanning for logins and payments, and a digital crown that you turn to switch in and out of virtual reality.
