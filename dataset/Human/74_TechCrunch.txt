Sam Chaudhary takes his time. The founder of ClassDojo, an edtech consumer app that focuses on student classrooms, spent eight years building the company before introducing a formal revenue model. All while raising over tens of millions in venture capital from elite Silicon Valley investors and eyeing a big mission: become the brand families can turn to when they think about a child’s education. Today, ClassDojo has raised over $200 million in venture capital. On this episode of TechCrunch Live taking place on April 26 at 12 p.m. PDT, we’ll get into how Chaudhary played the long-game in edtech and what he’d do differently if he was starting all over again. We’ll talk about opportunity in the sector in a post-pandemic landscape — and how he landed investor patience. Chaudhary will speak about his entrepreneurial journey with his investor Chris Farmer, the founder and CEO of SignalFire.
