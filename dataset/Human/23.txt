The UK's national fraud reporting centre is warning about fake emails pretending to raise money for victims of the war in Ukraine. Action Fraud has received 196 reports of bogus requests to fundraise for victims of the crisis. Scammers use a variety of methods to con donors, including selling charity T-shirts, it says. Some are even pretending to be Wladimir Klitschko, whose brother Vitali is mayor of Ukraine's capital, Kyiv. Action Fraud has shared advice about how to detect the scams: A representative said: "The links in the emails lead to malicious websites that are designed to steal your money and personal information. "When donating, check the charity's name and registration number on the government's website. "Most charities with an annual income of Â£5,000 or more must be registered."  According to the Charity Commission, the most efficient and helpful way to support those in need is to give money to established, registered charities with experience delivering humanitarian aid. Details of charities can be checked by searching the Charity Commission register.
