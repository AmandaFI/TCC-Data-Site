A stolen dog has died two months after being reunited with owner Rory Cellan-Jones following the former BBC correspondent's Twitter campaign to find her.  Cabbage, Mr Cellan-Jones's collie cross, was stolen along with five other dogs from a walker's van in November. All six animals were eventually found safe after Mr Cellan-Jones appealed to his Twitter followers for their return.  On Saturday he tweeted that his family "had to say goodbye" to Cabbage. The recently-retired journalist, who was a technology correspondent for the BBC, told his 97,000 Twitter followers: "For 14 years she was a lovely, energetic and really smart member of our family. "It was time for her to go but we miss her so much." News of Cabbage's theft was a hot online topic last year, and the social media appeal for her return resulted in thousands of retweets.  Cabbage had already attracted an online following before her theft in Acton, west London, as she regularly appeared in Mr Cellan-Jones's Twitter pictures of their early morning walks. He said the park felt "very empty" on Saturday morning as he thanked his followers for their support.  Former BBC colleagues tweeted their condolences. Presenter Sophie Raworth wrote: "I'm so sorry. I loved Cabbage's adventures."
