LinkedIn, the professional networking site owned by Microsoft, is launching a free identity and workplace verification system that lets users prove their identity and company affiliation. The new system will provide users with a verified badge that confirms their identity. Unlike the verified badges of many social media platforms, LinkedIn's verification system is free and doesn't require paying for a badge. The verification options that LinkedIn provides include using CLEAR for personal identity verification, verifying workplace affiliation through a company email, or using Microsoft Entra verified ID platform to get a digital workplace ID. Verification through company email is immediately available to users who work at one of the 4,000 supported companies. Verification through Entra will become available to 2 million LinkedIn members at the end of April. The Entra system is based on open standards and can be used across identity and HR systems. It aims to reduce the need for rigorous verification when employees begin a new job by enabling them to verify their skills and qualifications across multiple jobs and firms. Additionally, the Entra system has potential applications for background checks, loan applications, reward programs, and other scenarios where verification and trust are needed. The new identity and workplace verification system is the first major update to LinkedIn's profile verification process in many years. The new verification system is also coming on the heels of a hack of the LinkedIn platform that exposed user data to unauthorized persons. Microsoft is confident that the new system will provide LinkedIn users with greater security when using the platform. "Trust and transparency are critical in building and sustaining the professional relationships that are core to LinkedIn's mission, and we wanted to do our part in making it easier for members to share more about themselves and their work in a safe and secure manner," said Tomer Cohen, Head of Product at LinkedIn. "We know that verifying identity and workplace affiliation is an important signal of trust on LinkedIn, and we wanted to make these verification options available to our members for free.". With LinkedIn's new free identity and workplace verification system, users will be able to verify their identity and workplace affiliation and display a verified badge on their LinkedIn profile page. The new system also enables users to control how much information they share with other members. Users can choose to display their verified identity and workplace affiliation, or they can keep this information private. "Verification is a key piece of the trust puzzle on LinkedIn, and we're excited to be able to offer this new system to our members for free," said Mr. Cohen. "We know that trust is important to our users, whether they're job-hunting, networking, or building their personal brand. With our new verification system, we're giving them the tools they need to build that trust and move forward with confidence.".
