OpenAI, the AI research company co-founded by tech entrepreneur Elon Musk, has plugged its artificial intelligence-powered chatbot, ChatGPT, into the internet, providing customers with more accurate web-based information and increasing the functionality of the AI tool. OpenAI has launched several plugins that extend ChatGPT's functionality by granting access to third-party databases and knowledge sources, including the internet. The first-party web-browsing plugin retrieves content from the web using the Bing search API, which OpenAI claims provides more accurate information than Google. ChatGPT is a conversational AI programme that uses deep learning to understand and respond to natural language. It can generate text in response to open-ended questions or prompts and engage in conversations as if it were a human. OpenAI's move to link ChatGPT to the web is a significant step in the evolution of conversational AI. Despite AI's potential to revolutionize customer interactions, bots have traditionally been limited to a finite set of responses based on predefined rules. By connecting ChatGPT to the web, OpenAI is enhancing the functionality of its chatbot. It helps extend the range of potential answers the chatbot can offer through data sourced directly from the internet. This means that the bot is no longer limited to a predefined response based on a set of rules, but can instead retrieve information from the limitless array of data available on the internet. The development of plugins, including those from partners like Instacart and OpenTable, allows ChatGPT to interact with a broader range of services. For instance, with these plugins, the chatbot can book a reservation or place an order using natural language. There are concerns about the use of live web data, which is less filtered than bots' existing databases, and search engine algorithms' biases. Despite these concerns, OpenAI claims to have implemented safeguards to prevent undesirable behaviors by the chatbot. Moreover, the use of third-party plugins helps address legal issues such as ownership and control of data as companies retain full control of their data. Despite the advantages of using web-based data, OpenAI acknowledges that there are also significant risks and challenges associated with it. The uncontrollable nature of the internet means that the chatbot could retrieve misleading or potentially harmful information. The company is aware of these risks and developing ways to mitigate them. OpenAI's decision to plug ChatGPT into the internet is part of a broader trend of AI companies exploring web-based data sources. The goal is to create conversational AI tools that can provide more accurate, comprehensive, and timely information to customers. While there are risks associated with these developments, the potential benefits are significant. However, the move has raised concerns about how it might impact jobs. ChatGPT is effectively deploying AI in customer-facing roles, where, in theory, it can replace human customer service operatives. The rise of AI-powered chatbots may lead to the loss of jobs in traditional customer service roles, as AI-powered chatbots become more sophisticated. OpenAI's move to plug ChatGPT into the web is a significant step forward in the development of conversational AI. It will enable ChatGPT to offer a broader range of responses, increasing the accuracy and usefulness of the chatbot. However, the risks associated with using web-based data sources are significant. OpenAI must mitigate these risks and work towards ensuring that the benefits of AI-powered chatbots outweigh the potential drawbacks.
