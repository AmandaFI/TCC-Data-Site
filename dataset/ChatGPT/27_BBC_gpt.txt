Jack Ma: Alibaba founder seen in China after long absence. Alibaba founder, Jack Ma, has resurfaced after almost three years of staying out of the public eye. Ma was spotted visiting a school in Hangzhou. The 58-year old billionaire had largely kept a low profile since his critical comments on China’s financial regulators back in 2020. Reports indicate that his disappearance was part of a crackdown on tech entrepreneurs. Ma's recent travels to different countries were to learn more about agricultural technology. Ma is a vocal critic of traditional banks and the Chinese Communist Party. A Chinese tech titan, his rapid rise to fame made him a symbol of the country's economic emergence. However, his huge success also came at a cost, and his recent low profile prompted much speculation. Some feared for his safety while others believed that he may be under investigation. In January of this year, he resigned as the head of Alibaba affiliate Ant Group after Chinese regulators blocked the firm's proposed record-breaking $34 billion IPO in November 2020. Ant Group was going public with a $34.5bn dual listing in Hong Kong and Shanghai in November 2020 when Chinese authorities halted the initial public offering (IPO), stressing that "the company didn't meet the regulatory requirements''. The regulatory clampdowon followed just days after Jack Ma criticised China's financial regulators, saying that the traditional banking system stifled innovation. Analysts believe that the sudden suspension of the IPO and Chinese regulators' subsequent scrutiny of Ant Group highlighted regulatory risk in China's financial system. Shortly after the IPO debacle, Jack Ma disappeared from the public eye, sparking widespread speculation about his whereabouts. Alibaba Group Holdings, the parent company of Ant Group, owns China's largest e-commerce business and chips in a significant amount of its revenue from fintech via Ant Group. Jack's absence fuelled uncertainty about the company's future, causing its stock to plummet. However, his recent reappearance has several implications, most notably that the Chinese authorities and the tech mogul have reconciled. Ma's reappearance may signify a degree of normality and peace in his relationship with the Chinese government and regulators. Ma's time away from the public eye provided an opportunity for him to learn more about agriculture technology. His most recent visit to a school in Hangzhou seems an extension of this; he was there participating in a rural teacher-themed social welfare event. Interestingly, he also spoke with the headmasters of several schools and urged them to spread knowledge to students about rural China’s most pressing issues. . In conclusion, with Ma resurfacing, things may finally be looking up for Alibaba. His comeback has given a signal that he is ready to face the public again. However, it remains to be seen what his future engagements with the Chinese government will be.
