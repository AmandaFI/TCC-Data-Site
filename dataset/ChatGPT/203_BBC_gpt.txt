How will Tonga's broken internet cable be mended? Tonga, a small island nation in the South Pacific, has been cut off from the rest of the world after its only underwater fibre-optic cable was severed due to an undersea eruption followed by a tsunami. The cable, which spans nearly 50,000km and serves the South Pacific, is operated by Tonga Cable. It is estimated that it could take over a month to repair the breaks in the cable, leaving Tonga's 110,000 people without reliable internet access. To fix the cable, a pulse of light will be sent from the island to establish where the break is located. A cable-repair boat will then be sent to retrieve the broken end using either a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) or a grapnel tool. The broken end will be re-joined to fresh cable on board the boat, and the same process will occur at the other end of the break. If all goes well, the repair process will take between five and seven days. However, there are challenges that may prolong the repair process. The closest cable repair boat is currently stationed in Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea, about 4,700km away. Experts need to ensure the safety of the boat and crew and assess the risk of further volcanic eruptions before sending the boat to Tonga. Additionally, cable breaks caused by natural disasters are relatively rare, with 90% of breakages caused by fishing boat nets or anchors. On a global scale, about 200 cable repairs are carried out each year. The impact of the severed cable on Tonga is significant. While in Western countries, where there are multiple cables, the impact of one cable breaking is minimal, in Tonga, there was only one cable serving the entire country. This complete loss of connectivity has highlighted the vulnerability of Tonga's internet infrastructure. Mr. Jamieson, a principal engineer at Virgin Media, suggests that having at least two cables serving an area is ideal. Currently, there are over 430 cables worldwide spanning a total distance of 1.3 million km. In 2019, Tonga signed a 15-year deal for satellite connectivity after a previous cable break caused by a ship's anchor. However, even satellite phones are being affected by the volcanic ash in Tonga, limiting their use to government officials and select businesses. To mitigate the loss of internet access, mobile network provider Digicel has set up a temporary 2G system using the University of the South Pacific's satellite dish. While this offers some connectivity, the service is patchy, and internet services run slowly. The importance of these cables varies depending on the region. In Western countries, where there are many cables, the impact of one cable breaking is minimal. However, in countries like Tonga, which heavily rely on a single cable, a break can be catastrophic. Tonga's government is now reconsidering its internet infrastructure and exploring options for redundancy and backup connectivity to ensure such a severe loss of access does not occur again in the future. As Tonga awaits the repair of its underwater cable, the country's people remain cut off from the world, impacting businesses, education, and everyday communication. The repair process is expected to take some time due to logistical challenges, but experts are working diligently to reconnect the nation to the digital realm. In the meantime, Tonga is relying on temporary measures to maintain some level of connectivity, however limited it may be.
