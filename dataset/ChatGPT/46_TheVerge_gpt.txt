Disney has reportedly eliminated its Next Generation Storytelling and Consumer Experiences division in what is thought to be the first round of planned layoffs. The division employed around 50 employees and was responsible for exploring how Disney could enter the "metaverse", which has been described as the next big storytelling frontier. The division's main aim was to investigate how Disney could use its existing intellectual property to create new experiences for its consumers. While it remains unclear exactly what the team was working on, former CEO Bob Chapek suggested that it could include fantasy sports, theme-park attractions, and other consumer experiences. However, after Bob Iger replaced Chapek as CEO in November, it seems that the division's work has been abruptly halted. As part of Iger's plan to cut costs and streamline operations, it's been reported that the company will lay off a total of 7,000 workers across all divisions, saving approximately $5.5 billion. News of the layoffs was first reported by The Hollywood Reporter, which cited anonymous sources. Disney has not yet officially confirmed the news, but it's expected that the company will announce further details in the coming weeks. The move has been viewed by some industry commentators as a significant shift in Disney's strategy. Many had expected the company to be at the forefront of developments in the metaverse, which is seen as the next big thing in entertainment. The metaverse refers to a virtual world in which people can interact with one another and with digital content in real-time. It's been described as a kind of internet 2.0, where users can live, work, and play in immersive virtual environments. For Disney, the metaverse presented an opportunity to leverage its vast library of intellectual property and create new experiences for its customers. However, it seems that the company has decided to focus its efforts elsewhere, at least for now. In a statement to The Verge, a Disney spokesperson declined to comment on the reports of the division's closure. However, they said that the company remained "committed to leveraging technology to drive innovation and creativity across our businesses.". The news of the layoffs comes as Disney continues to grapple with the fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic. The company's theme parks have been closed or operating at reduced capacity, while movie theaters have been shuttered, leading to a significant drop in revenue. As a result, Disney has been forced to make tough decisions about where to cut costs. While the closure of the Next Generation Storytelling and Consumer Experiences division may be a setback for the company's metaverse ambitions, it's clear that Disney is determined to weather the current storm.
