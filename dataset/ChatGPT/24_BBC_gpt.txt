Twitter’s new subscription service has caused the iconic blue verification badge on the social media platform to disappear, due to a clash involving Elon Musk, CEO of SpaceX and Tesla, and The New York Times (NYT). The badge would previously appear on the accounts of public figures and organisations to verify their authenticity and credibility on the platform. Now, celebrities and organisations are being asked to pay either a $1,000 monthly fee for a gold verification badge, or $8 for the blue badge, which was previously free. However, the process took a dramatic turn when the NYT declined to pay for the badge, prompting Twitter to remove the blue verification badge from all of its accounts. CEO of Twitter Jack Dorsey confirmed the move, saying that the company is “moving away from focusing on verification, as it causes confusion and unfairness for users”. According to internal Twitter documents, the new rules state that 10,000 of the most-followed organisations on Twitter are exempt from the rule, which includes the likes of CNN, the Los Angeles Times and the Washington Post. Elon Musk took to social media to express his frustration at the new policy and the decision to remove the badge from The New York Times. In a now-deleted tweet, he said: “What’s the point of verification if it doesn't mean anything anymore?”. The SpaceX and Tesla CEO is no stranger to social media controversy. In recent months, he has been in the headlines for a series of tweets about the coronavirus pandemic and the use of Hydroxychloroquine as a treatment. He has also been criticised for his remarks about the Thai cave rescue last year, which resulted in a lawsuit. The removal of the blue verification badge has raised concerns that it will be difficult to distinguish genuine accounts from imposters, with users potentially falling for fake accounts posing as celebrities or organisations. This sentiment was echoed by social media experts, who described the move as a step back for the platform. Aaron Goldman, CMO of 4C Insights, said: "Twitter is running the risk of confusing users who heavily rely on verification to identify legitimate influencers and public figures. Removing badges altogether might only make things worse.”. Despite the backlash, Twitter appears to be sticking to its decision and is urging users to trust its algorithms to identify genuine accounts. A statement from the company read: “We believe that our new subscription service, and the streamlined verification process that comes with it, will create a safer and more authentic online environment for users.”. However, the move could have wider implications for social media as a whole. Verification badges have been seen as a way of combating the rise of fake news and online trolling, and their removal by Twitter may result in other platforms following suit. The move also raises questions about the commercialisation of social media, with companies and individuals being asked to pay for verification badges. As social media continues to grow in popularity, it remains to be seen whether the platform will remain a public space or become a tool for big businesses and media companies. For now, the removal of the blue verification badge is causing ripples in the online world, with users left to wonder how they can trust the authenticity of what they see. Regardless of how the situation unfolds, one thing is certain – social media is changing and users will have to adapt to survive.
