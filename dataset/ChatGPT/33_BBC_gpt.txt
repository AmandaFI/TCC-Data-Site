The Phones That Detect Earthquakes. Google has teamed up with the US Geological Survey (USGS) and California universities to develop an earthquake warning system. The system harnesses technology from most Android phones to detect early signs of earthquakes, providing people with a few seconds of advance warning. The project is part of Google's commitment to using technology to improve disaster response and prevention. The system relies on data from a network of over 700 seismometers across California, as well as the world's largest earthquake detection network from smartphones. Most Android phones have an onboard accelerometer that can act as a miniature seismometer, measuring movement and vibration. Sensors installed in the ground detect primary waves, which are the first waves to travel from the epicenter of an earthquake. These waves are then picked up by Android phones, which use algorithms to distinguish between normal vibration and seismic activity. By combining data from thousands of smartphones, Google is able to determine if an earthquake is occurring. In the event of an earthquake, the system will provide a warning a few seconds before the tremors reach the surface. The warning system works through internet access via Wi-Fi or mobile data, so it can be accessed by anyone with an Android phone and internet connection. The system is particularly useful for people who may not be near a seismometer or earthquake detection center. Dr. Richard Allen, the director of the UC Berkeley Seismological Laboratory, which is part of the project, said: "What we have found is that if we can spot the earthquake before you can feel it, we can give you a warning that ranges from a few seconds to tens of seconds. That can be the difference between life and death.". The early warning system is particularly important in earthquake-prone areas like California, where people need as much time as possible to seek shelter or evacuate before an earthquake hits. According to the USGS, the state experiences up to 15,000 earthquakes each year, with around 500 of these being strong enough to cause damage. California Governor Gavin Newsom praised the new system, saying: "California is earthquake country, and we need all the help we can get to help identify and alert residents to potentially dangerous situations. Technology that can detect earthquakes early and alert people is a welcome addition to California's earthquake resilience toolkit.". The project has been in development for several years, with Google collaborating closely with seismologists and earthquake experts to refine the technology. The system is now being rolled out to Android users across California, with plans for wider adoption in the future. Google has committed to using technology to improve disaster response and prevention, with initiatives such as its Crisis Response team and tools like Google Maps that can help people navigate natural disasters. The early warning system is seen as a key component of the company's disaster response efforts, as providing people with advance warning can reduce the impact of disasters and save lives. The system has already been put to the test, with one user reporting that they received a warning before a 5.3 magnitude earthquake hit Southern California in April 2020. The warning was enough time for them to get under a table before the shaking began. The early warning system is also being used by businesses and organizations to help them prepare for earthquakes. For example, the Los Angeles Metro transport system is using the system to slow down trains and protect passengers and staff in the event of an earthquake. The system has also been used in international markets, with Google partnering with the Indonesian government to provide early warnings for earthquakes and tsunamis in the region. Indonesia is one of the most earthquake-prone countries in the world, with a history of devastating earthquakes that have caused widespread damage and loss of life. The project demonstrates the potential for technology to play a critical role in mitigating the impact of natural disasters. By harnessing the power of smartphones and big data, Google is providing people with a powerful tool to help them prepare for and respond to earthquakes. With the world facing an increasing number of natural disasters, it is clear that technology will continue to play a vital role in disaster response and prevention. The phones that detect earthquakes are just one example of how innovation can help save lives and protect communities.
