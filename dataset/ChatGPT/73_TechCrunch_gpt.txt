London-based start-up Deep Render has secured $9m in a series A funding round to support development of its AI-powered video compression technology. The firm plans to conduct research and development into its technology with the funding, as well as concentrate on a push to attract US customers. Deep Render has already been awarded a €2.7m grant from the European Innovation Council. The company claims the machine learning and AI in its platform can compress video up to five times better than the industry standard, based on a dataset of more than 10 million video sequences.  . Deep Render, the UK start-up behind an AI system that compresses video sequences more efficiently, has secured $9m in a series A funding round. The company, based in central London and founded in 2018, intends to use the funds to research and develop its deep-learning technology platform which it claims can achieve industry-leading outcomes in video compression.  . The funding will also support Deep Render's desire to target the US market as well as supporting product development. The start-up, which raised $1.5m in seed funding in its founding year, was awarded a €2.7m ($3.2m) grant by the European Innovation Council earlier in the year.  . "We are thrilled to raise this funding," said Deep Render CEO Chri Besenbruch. "We are now undertaking research and development to ensure that our technology remains cutting-edge and delivers the best possible service to our clients.".  . Deep Render's platform uses machine learning and AI to compress video more effectively than other systems. The company claims its platform is up to five times better than the industry standard. Although currently targeting the media industry, the technology could potentially be used in autonomous vehicles and other applications which require efficient processing of video streams.  . The firm, which is growing at an annual rate of 500%, benefited from "internal milestones" that led to the series A investment, according to Besenbruch.  . "We've been expanding our team, deepening our expertise, and pushing the limits of what AI and machine learning can do," he said. "Our work has paid off, and we are now seeing the fruits of our labour.".  . Deep Render's clients include major broadcasters and media companies, as well as autonomous vehicle firms involved in developing self-driving technology and e-sports companies. The firm has grown quickly since its launch in 2018, gaining significant investment from venture capital firms such as Fly Ventures and Accel.  . Its technology uses a neural network driven by deep learning to predict pixel values in a high-resolution image with a reduced file size based on machine learning techniques, the system is able to significantly reduce the file size of video without significant loss in quality. Deep Render says its compression rate of 40:1 is five times better than the current industry standard while offering significant time and cost savings.  . Besenbruch said the $9m secured in the series A round will enable the company to invest in deepening its AI expertise, pushing its already expanding team to "new heights" and allowing it to fully explore new and exciting ways of utilising deep learning.  . Through better use of AI and machine learning, the firm says it can offer cost savings, improving efficiency and performance across the board. By developing its innovative technology with the potential to revolutionise the video and imaging industries, Deep Render is staking its claim as a leader in the field.  . As with other areas of the technology industry, the use of AI and machine learning is transforming the video compression industry. Many companies are working to develop more efficient systems for compressing video, thus offering consumers an improved viewing experience and reducing the pressure on bandwidth that video streaming places on networks. Deep Render's technology has been honed and tested with the help of a database containing more than 10 million video sequences.  . Deep Render's growth rate and success demonstrate that it has not only developed one of the best AI-powered video compression solutions, but that it has the expertise and business plan to compete at the highest level in the technology industry. While it currently dominates with media companies, its work with e-sports and autonomous vehicle firms shows it has identified exciting use cases for the technology that could be booming industries in the coming years. The latest funding will push the start-up a step closer to capitalising on those opportunities.
