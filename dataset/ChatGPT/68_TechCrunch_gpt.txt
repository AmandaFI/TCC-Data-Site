Creative platform EVEN raises $2.2M seed round to help artists sell directly to fans. EVEN, a creative platform that allows artists to sell music directly to fans, has raised $2.2m in a seed funding round led by CSA Partners. The platform aims to help black and brown artists retain equity in their creative work by connecting them directly with fans, who receive access to exclusive content and experiences in return. . EVEN is built on the blockchain, a digital ledger that records every transaction and provides greater transparency in negotiations. By utilizing the decentralized technology, the platform seeks to disrupt the traditional music industry by empowering artists and creating a more equitable ecosystem. The company hopes to launch this year with more than 600 artists, and has a waitlist of over 4,000. The seed funding will be used for the platform's growth, to hire further staff and to provide marketing and promotional support for the artists signed up to the platform. EVEN's co-founder and CEO, Kelechi Udoagwu, said: "We're thrilled to have the support of CSA Partners and our other investors as we work to empower creatives and grow a more equitable music industry. Our platform helps black and brown artists keep control of their work and connect directly with their fans. By providing greater transparency and empowering creators, we hope to create a new era in music.". CSA Partners Managing Partner, Kaedan Capital, said: "We're excited to partner with EVEN as the platform seeks to disrupt the traditional music industry and create a more equitable ecosystem for artists and fans. This technology-first approach has immense potential and we look forward to seeing the impact made by EVEN.". The rise of streaming platforms over the past decade has led to significant changes in the music industry. While digital distribution has created new opportunities for artists to reach their fans, it has also increased their reliance on third-party platforms. By selling their work directly to fans through EVEN, artists are able to bypass traditional gatekeepers and retain greater control over their output, intellectual property and revenue streams. As EVEN promises to connect artists and fans in a more direct and equitable way, it has already experienced a high level of demand from prospective users. The company has received applications from over 4,000 artists hoping to join its platform, which it aims to launch later this year. . By enabling greater transparency in transactions, as well as offering marketing and promotional support, EVEN is seeking to disrupt the music industry by offering a new model of distribution that benefits creators and consumers alike. The platform could prove a game-changer in an industry often criticised for its lack of diversity and protectiveness of established players. EVEN's blockchain-based model offers a way for black and brown artists to maintain creative control, and to share their work with fans in a more direct and sustainable way. By opening up new revenue streams, its goal is to make the music industry a more equitable place for all involved.
