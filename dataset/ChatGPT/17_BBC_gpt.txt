The Other Chinese Apps Taking the US and UK by Storm. Chinese-owned mobile apps have seen a surge in popularity in Western markets, with three of the top 10 free mobile apps in the US estimated to be owned by Chinese companies. Mobile video editing tool CapCut, shopping app Temu, and fashion brand Shein have all taken the US and UK by storm, according to analytics firm Apptopia. Experts attribute the success of these Chinese apps in Western markets to the intense competition in China's domestic market, where US apps are banned. The restrictions on US firms have led to a vibrant home-grown app industry that is highly aggressive in its marketing strategies and offers a wide range of products and services. However, concerns have been raised about the data privacy breaches and censorship exercised by the Chinese Communist Party through these apps. Lawmakers have also sought reassurances from TikTok, one of the most popular apps among US users, about its data security policies. "The rise of Chinese-owned apps in Western markets is a reflection of the increasing globalization of the tech industry," said Sarah Oh, an expert on Chinese tech industry at Smith College in Massachusetts. "Just as Western companies sought to expand into Asian markets, Chinese companies are looking beyond their borders to reach global audiences.". CapCut, which was launched by Chinese internet giant ByteDance last year, offers a comprehensive set of tools for video editing, including filters, effects, and transitions. The app has gained a large following among younger audiences, who are keen to produce and share videos on social media platforms such as TikTok and YouTube. Temu, a shopping app, was launched in 2017 and has since become one of the most popular e-commerce platforms in China. It offers a wide range of products, including clothing, electronics, and household appliances, at competitive prices. The app has already gained a foothold in Western markets, thanks to its user-friendly interface and fast delivery times. Shein, a fashion brand, is also making waves in the Western market with its affordable and trendy clothing lines. The brand was founded in China in 2008 and has since expanded its reach to over 220 countries. It has become particularly popular among younger audiences who are looking for affordable yet stylish clothing options. However, experts have raised concerns about the data privacy breaches and censorship exercised by the Chinese Communist Party through these apps. China has strict regulations governing data privacy, which require companies to store user data within the country, and give the government access to it if requested. This has led to concerns that Chinese-owned apps could share user data with the Communist Party, which could then use it for surveillance or other purposes. There are also concerns about censorship of content that is deemed sensitive or inappropriate by the Chinese authorities. "TikTok is a prime example of the risks and challenges posed by Chinese apps in Western markets," said Oh. "The app has been accused of sharing user data with the Chinese government, which has prompted concerns about the potential for surveillance and censorship.". US lawmakers have sought reassurances from TikTok about its access to user data, and the app has faced scrutiny from regulators over its data security policies. The company has also faced public backlash over allegations of censorship, with some users claiming that their content was removed or restricted by the app's algorithm. Despite these concerns, the use of Chinese-owned apps in Western markets is likely to continue to grow. The intense competition in China's domestic market means that Chinese companies are highly innovative and adaptable, which gives them an edge over their Western counterparts. "The rise of Chinese-owned apps in Western markets is a reflection of the changing landscape of the tech industry," said Oh. "We are seeing a shift from the dominance of Western firms to a more diverse and global industry, with Chinese companies playing an increasingly important role.". As Chinese-owned apps continue to gain popularity in Western markets, the debate over data privacy and censorship is likely to intensify, with regulators and lawmakers calling for tougher standards and greater transparency from app developers. However, as the global tech industry continues to evolve, it remains to be seen whether Western societies will be willing to embrace the increasing influence of Chinese-owned apps.
