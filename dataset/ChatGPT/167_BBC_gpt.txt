Rise of the five-year-old 'TikTots'. A recent study conducted by Ofcom, the UK's communications regulator, has revealed that an increasing number of children as young as five are using social media platforms, despite age restrictions requiring users to be at least 13 years old. The study found that one-third of parents with children aged five to seven reported that their child had a social media profile. Among eight to eleven-year-olds, TikTok was the most popular platform, with one in three children having an account, despite the platform's minimum age requirement of 13. Ofcom's study also noted the presence of even younger children, labeled as "TikTots," watching videos on TikTok, including 16% of three to four-year-olds. However, it is important to note that this does not necessarily mean they have their own accounts, as they may be watching videos shown to them by parents or older individuals. Yih-Choung Teh, Ofcom's strategy and research director, expressed surprise at the findings, stating that he was amazed to learn that 60% of his own children's peers had social media profiles. He also highlighted the fact that big-tech platforms set minimum ages but do not effectively enforce them. The study revealed that some parents were knowingly allowing their children to have social media profiles before they reached the minimum age requirement. For instance, 22% of parents with three to four-year-olds and 38% of parents with eight to eleven-year-olds said they would allow their children to have social media profiles before they reached the required age. Ofcom suggested that many children may be using alternative accounts or "finstas" (fake Instagram accounts) to hide certain aspects of their online activities from parents. The study found that two out of three eight to eleven-year-olds had multiple accounts or profiles on social media. In addition, nearly half of these children had an account specifically for their family to see. The study also revealed that some children were adept at circumventing parental control features. Shockingly, one in 20 children managed to bypass these controls to access restricted apps and websites. While there are ongoing concerns about online safety, the study also showed that many children had positive experiences online. Among thirteen to seventeen-year-olds, 53% believed that being online was good for their mental health. However, the study also brought to light an issue with media literacy. While 70% of adults believed they could identify misinformation, only 20% were able to correctly identify the signs of a genuine post. The proportions were even lower among twelve to seventeen-year-olds, with only 10% able to accurately identify genuine posts. Overall, the study emphasizes the need for improved enforcement of age restrictions on social media platforms, as well as increased media literacy education for both parents and children. Yih-Choung Teh expressed concerns about big-tech platforms' lack of effective enforcement and highlighted the need for parents to take a more proactive role in monitoring their children's online activities. With more children gaining access to social media platforms at younger ages, it is imperative that steps are taken to ensure their safety online. Parents, educators, and tech companies must work together to address these challenges and protect our youngest generation.
