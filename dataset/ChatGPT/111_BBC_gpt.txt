Generative AI chatbots are disrupting the traditional job application process, as jobseekers are using them to write cover letters, CVs and emails. This technology is being hailed as the future of hiring, but experts suggest it will force recruiters to alter their evaluation criteria. According to an expert in sociology and cultural studies at the University of Kent, UK, chatbots are gaining popularity among jobseekers because they can compose job applications on demand. These AI bots use algorithms and natural language processing to generate text that resembles human writing. One such chatbot, ChatGPT, has been making waves in the recruitment industry. Developed by OpenAI, ChatGPT uses a pre-trained language model to generate text that is convincing and natural-sounding. Users can provide prompts, such as "write a cover letter for a marketing position," and ChatGPT will generate a customised letter. The rise of generative AI chatbots like ChatGPT is expected to have a significant impact on the recruitment industry. Recruiters may no longer receive applications written by jobseekers themselves. Instead, chatbots could completely take over the process. The use of generative AI chatbots could represent a shift in traditional recruitment methods. Hiring managers may be forced to alter their evaluation criteria, as the language used by chatbots is formulaic and without personality. Employers will have to place greater emphasis on face-to-face interaction to evaluate cultural fit and soft skills, as chatbots cannot provide this feedback. Experts suggest that AI-targeted tests can provide recruiters with data-driven behavioural insights. These tests can evaluate a candidate's suitability for a given role by analysing their online behaviour and interactions. This data can then be used to assess a candidate's personality traits, work styles and strengths. While generative AI chatbots may be suitable for time-poor recruiters, employers will still need to evaluate cultural fit and soft skills through face-to-face interactions. Chatbots may be able to write cover letters and CVs, but they cannot provide feedback on a candidate's personality or communication skills. Nevertheless, the use of generative AI chatbots in recruitment is growing. They offer an efficient and cost-effective way for jobseekers to apply for jobs. However, it remains to be seen how well employers will adapt to these new technologies and how they will incorporate them into their recruitment processes. "The development of generative AI chatbots is exciting and offers numerous benefits for both jobseekers and recruiters," says Sally Wyatt, Professor of Digital Cultures at Maastricht University, Netherlands. "However, employers must be careful to ensure that they still evaluate cultural fit and soft skills in a meaningful and effective way.". The rise of generative AI chatbots also raises concerns about job security for human recruiters. While chatbots can effectively generate job applications, they cannot replace human interaction. Human recruiters have important skills that are difficult to replicate with technology, such as intuition, empathy and decision-making. As such, experts suggest that generative AI chatbots should be viewed as a complementary tool for recruiters, rather than a replacement. While they can help reduce the workload and offer a cost-effective solution, they cannot fully replace human recruiters when it comes to evaluating cultural fit and soft skills. In conclusion, generative AI chatbots are changing the way job applications are written and submitted. They offer a cost-effective and efficient solution for jobseekers, but they also pose challenges for recruiters. Employers will have to adapt to these new technologies and find ways to incorporate them into their recruitment processes, while still evaluating soft skills and cultural fit in a meaningful way.
