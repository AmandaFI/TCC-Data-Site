Twitter is drawing criticism for its decision to give a parody Disney account called "DisneyJuniorUK" a verified badge, leading to serious concerns regarding platform's new verification system. Many celebrities on the platform had lost their badges, but almost all of them were reinstated over the weekend, including accounts with more than a million followers. However, Twitter's verification system is still facing backlash for giving verified status to a fake account. Social media consultant Matt Navarra has said that the removal of legacy checkmarks was a "big mistake." Navarra went on to criticize Tesla CEO Elon Musk's ownership of Twitter, saying that it has created "the perfect breeding ground for fake accounts and misinformation." . Critics are warning that verified accounts can use their verified status to share misinformation under the guise of authority. The distinct blue checkmark has become a symbol of trustworthiness on the platform; the decision to award verified status to a fake account that perpetuates misinformation raises doubts about the platform's ability to carry out proper verification. . Twitter's verification system was redesigned in May this year, allowing nearly everyone to submit an application for the blue checkmark. The unverified masses are now able to prove their identity on Twitter, while previously, only those with a large following would be considered for verification. . However, this system has had its fair share of hiccups. In June, Twitter publicized that it would revoke verified blue checkmarks of accounts that breach the platform's codes of conduct. This decision was met with disapproval by many users who disagreed with the criteria used to determine which accounts received verification. Another problem that Twitter faces is accounts sharing disinformation and spreading hate speech. Recently, the platform removed a tweet by Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro for misinformation related to COVID-19. Twitter is under pressure to better moderate content on its platform and remove disinformation altogether, but it's an ongoing conflict between moderation and free expression. . Twitter's new verification system was intended to be more inclusive, offering users a chance to prove their identity and gain public trust. While the platform made strides in making verification more accessible, it still has more work to do to prevent abuse, fake accounts, and misinformation. Twitter's alleged failure to carry out proper verification is a blow to the faith of millions of users who rely on the platform for daily news and communication.
