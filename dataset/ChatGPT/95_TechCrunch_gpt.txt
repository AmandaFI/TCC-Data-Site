Apple TV has launched a beta version of its much-anticipated Multiview feature for sports fans during its MLB Friday Night Baseball livestream. The innovative feature only works for users with tvOS beta version 16.5, allowing them to watch up to four games simultaneously in a grid format on their screens. Multiview offers customisable viewing options, enabling users to switch between the various games with ease. The remote control also allows users to switch between audio, providing an enhanced experience. Multiview is currently limited to Apple's sports offerings, such as MLS Season Pass and MLB Friday Night Baseball. However, the company has yet to provide a specific timeline for a wider launch. YouTube TV is also testing a similar Multiview feature, but on a limited scale aimed at a select number of US users. Apple's offering is likely to be more advanced and bespoke. A spokesperson for Apple TV said, "We know that sports fans are always looking for new ways to get closer to their favourite teams and matches, and Multiview offers a completely new way to watch the action. Apple TV is committed to innovation and bringing exciting new features to our users.". The introduction of Multiview comes as streaming giants compete to offer users a range of different experiences. Smart TVs and box sets have become increasingly popular, with customers demanding a more personalised viewing experience. Apple TV has consistently sought to enhance its offering and has introduced a number of innovative features, including Siri voice recognition and personalised recommendations. The company's commitment to ongoing innovation is likely to continue, with the aim of standing out from its competitors. There are other benefits to the Multiview feature for sports fans, including not having to miss any live coverage. The ability to watch four games simultaneously is likely to appeal to those with multiple sporting interests or those who want to catch up on multiple matches without missing live action. Apple TV's innovation in the live streaming market is also noteworthy, and Multiview only adds to the company's growing reputation as a pioneer in this field. Overall, Apple TV's Multiview feature is an exciting new offering for sports fans looking to expand their viewing capabilities. With the beta version only serving a select audience, expectations are high for the Multiview feature's full instalment on a wider scale. Apple TV's innovation and commitment to a personalised viewing experience are sure to make this feature a hit with sports fans around the world.
