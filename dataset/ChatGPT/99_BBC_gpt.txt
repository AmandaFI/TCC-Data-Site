Nottingham Trent University (NTU) has announced plans to establish a new sport and wellbeing academy to provide free exercise and nutrition advice to NHS patients in the greater Nottingham area. The new academy will offer patients referred by the Clifton and Meadows NHS Primary Care Network Social Prescribing Service the opportunity to access individual consultations and to participate in exercise programs led by trained health professionals. The academy will be well equipped with consultation rooms and a studio containing exercise equipment where patients can receive tailored fitness programs. The academy will also cater to the needs of NTU sports teams, providing them with facilities such as performance assessment suites, rehabilitation rooms, and video analysis rooms. NTU hopes to work closely with the primary and secondary schools in the Nottingham area and to collaborate with the wider community in order to improve the delivery of health and wellbeing programs. Dr. Chris Husbands, Vice Chancellor of NTU explained further that “The new academy will be a cutting-edge resource for both our student athletes and for the local community. The academy plays a key role in addressing health inequalities and improving health outcomes for those who need support the most. It’s a fantastic example of how NTU’s sports program is not just about producing athletes who win medals, but about supporting the wider community and creating a positive impact.”. The creation of the academy will be a significant step towards bridging the health inequality gap in the region. Promoting a healthy lifestyle and providing free fitness consultation services to the local community and the university students alike will have a knock-on effect of reducing preventable health conditions in the region and promoting healthy habits. The academy will also complement the plans for a new medical school being set up in the city, which will provide students with opportunities to access training in a wide range of medical disciplines.
