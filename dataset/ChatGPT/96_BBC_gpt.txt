Guernsey children's screen time has increased significantly since the Covid-19 pandemic-led lockdown, according to the Guernsey States' Early Years Team. Parents, who have increasingly become dependent on technology, have resorted to using digital devices as a "digital babysitter", causing concern amongst child behaviour experts. Ruth Sharp of the Early Years Team also warned that excessive screen time could hinder language and communication development, especially for those children who have been unable to socialise due to lockdown measures. Many parents have found themselves juggling working from home with caring for their children, leaving little time for in-person interaction. As a result, digital devices have become a convenient way to keep children occupied while parents work. However, Ms Sharp has issued a warning about the possible consequences of relying on screen time as a solution for child care. She called for more in-person interaction for young children to ensure they develop language and social skills properly. She also suggested that parents and caregivers set rules around the use of screens to ensure that children's screen time doesn't become excessive. The Guernsey Education, Sport, and Culture Committee has provided a Â£5m($6.9m) Covid recovery package. Part of the funding will be used for digital education initiatives to support young people's learning. However, there are concerns this could lead to an increase in screen time for children. The Guernsey States' Early Years Team is calling for more investment in physical spaces where young children can interact, such as toddler groups and soft play areas. These provide opportunities for children to socialise while learning language and communication skills. Guernsey is not the only place where children's screen time has increased since the Covid-19 lockdowns began. Concerns have been raised by experts globally about the potential long-term impact excessive screen time could have on children's development. However, as the pandemic continues, parents are continuing to rely on digital devices to keep their children entertained. It is anticipated that this trend will continue until social restrictions are lifted.
