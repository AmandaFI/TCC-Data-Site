Japanese conglomerate SoftBank Group has sold its South Korea-based venture capital arm, SoftBank Ventures Asia, to Singaporean investment firm, The Edgeof. The financial details of the deal have not been disclosed, but The Edgeof aims to complete the acquisition this year and collaborate with SoftBank’s Mistletoe venture capital unit to find “game-changing” startups. With around $2bn in assets under management, SoftBank Ventures Asia has invested in various Asian portfolios. SoftBank’s decision to dispose of the business follows significant losses resulting from the tech slump and macroeconomic slowdown. The company recently announced plans to curtail startup investments by 50% to 75% towards March 2023. The acquisition signals The Edgeof’s expansion plans into Asia. Founded in 2015, the Singaporean firm is led by Joon An, brother of Softbank CEO and Founder Masayoshi Son. Its investment strategy aligns with SoftBank in that it seeks out businesses with high potential, supporting their growth and development. Edgeof’s vision extends beyond just providing funding; it involves building a comprehensive ecosystem around its startup investments. The firm’s portfolio comprises a diverse range of businesses from music streaming to mobile gaming. For SoftBank, the move to dispose of SoftBank Ventures Asia enables the firm to focus on its core businesses, which include the $100bn SoftBank Vision Fund. The tech conglomerate posted a record $17.7bn loss in the fiscal year ended March 2020, prompting a change in investment strategy. The company is now placing greater scrutiny on its investments while exploring additional fundraising opportunities. The pullback in startup investments is expected to result in significant savings for SoftBank, as the company looks to improve its financial position. The acquisition by The Edgeof cements its place as one of the most active investors in the region. Through its investments, the Singaporean firm aims to promote digital transformation in Asia. Its investment strategy is driven by a belief in a future dominated by innovative businesses and a sense of community. Joon An said SoftBank Ventures Asia and Mistletoe have paved the way for The Edgeof to discover new and exciting opportunities in the region. He highlighted the experience gained from the close partnership, adding that his team is excited about the prospect of working with successful entrepreneurs who can contribute to building an optimal ecosystem. The Edgeof is looking to extend its influence further into Southeast Asia, particularly following the launch of Edge Ubiquitous, a 10-year US$1bn fund focused on smart city and Internet of Things (IoT) innovation. The investment vehicle aims to digitise and automate city infrastructures to enhance the quality of life in megacities. The fund has already commenced operations in Bangkok, with plans to expand into cities across Indonesia, Malaysia, and other parts of Thailand. SoftBank Ventures Asia was set up in 2000 and was initially created to ease SoftBank’s entry into South Korea. Over the years, the venture unit has grown into one of the most active venture capital investors in the region. Its impressive portfolio encompasses investments in food delivery, gaming, payment solutions, and transportation. Some of its most prominent investments include Tokopedia, Indonesia’s leading e-commerce firm, and Korbit, a South Korean bitcoin exchange. The acquisition by The Edgeof signals a significant shift in focus for SoftBank, as it looks to weather the impact of the macroeconomic slowdown and tech slump. The move also illustrates that the Singaporean firm is one of the dominant forces driving digital transformation in Southeast Asia and beyond.
