Social media is doomed to die, according to Ellis Hamburger, a former reporter for The Verge who worked at Snapchat and is a current shareholder. In a recent exposé, Hamburger claimed that Snapchat was created to be a healthier and more ethical social media platform than its predecessors. However, he argues that Snapchat ultimately gave in to common growth hacks and push notifications that signaled its decline. Hamburger claims that Snapchat's evolution from an app built for messaging to an app for broadcasting, like other social media platforms, led to its misalignment with user needs. Many social media apps, he observes, seem fated to manipulate and disappoint their users. While some of the new crop of social platforms that are emerging, such as protocols like Mastodon and intimate apps like Locket and BeReal, aim to create new experiences based on users’ needs, Hamburger questions whether these platforms can gain traction without the promise of growth that attracts investors. "It’s simply a far less lucrative business model than the one Mark Zuckerberg came up with all those years ago," argues Hamburger. Hamburger's article has caused quite a stir in the tech world, with some arguing that his assessment of Snapchat's downfall is spot-on, while others argue that Hamburger is oversimplifying the complexities of the social media landscape. In an interview with Forbes, Hamburger elaborated on his argument. "Social media platforms are built on a model of growth at all costs," he said. "But that growth often comes at the expense of users' well-being and privacy. As users become more aware of these issues, they are likely to move on to platforms that prioritize their needs. At the same time, investors are likely to become more discerning about the companies they back, and will choose to invest in platforms that have a more sustainable and ethical business model.". Hamburger pointed to the rise of decentralized social platforms like Mastodon, which allow users to control their own data and interact with others on their own terms. He also highlighted the success of more intimate social platforms like Locket and BeReal, which prioritize users' privacy and well-being over growth and advertising revenue. However, some experts in the social media industry are skeptical that these alternative platforms can gain significant traction in a market dominated by behemoths like Facebook and Twitter. "It's certainly true that there is growing concern among consumers about the negative impact of social media on their mental health and privacy," said John Horrigan, senior fellow at the Technology Policy Institute. "But it's also true that social media is an incredibly powerful tool for connecting people and sharing information. It's hard to imagine that people will simply abandon these platforms en masse in favor of something that is less well-known or less established.". Others argue that the problems with social media go beyond the platforms themselves, and are rooted in broader societal issues like fake news and political polarization. "Social media is simply a tool that amplifies the voices and ideas of its users," said Michael Cornfield, research director for the Global Digital Politics Research Trust. "If we want to address the problems with social media, we need to address the underlying issues that are driving these negative trends.". Despite the criticisms, Hamburger remains convinced that social media is a fundamentally flawed industry. "For too long, we've been sold the myth that social media is the answer to our problems," he said. "But the reality is that social media is part of the problem. If we want to create a better future for ourselves and our communities, we need to start thinking beyond social media and start building platforms that prioritize our well-being, privacy, and dignity.".
