Kohler, a leading manufacturer of plumbing products, has announced the release of its innovative PerfectFill technology at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2022. This groundbreaking technology allows users to effortlessly fill up their bathtub with a simple voice command, thanks to the integration of smart bath technology. The PerfectFill system comprises a drain kit and digital valve, which work in harmony to draw the bathwater to the desired temperature and depth. Users have the option to control the system either through the Kohler Konnect app or by using voice commands. Additionally, users can even program up to 10 different bath times, making it convenient for a personalized experience. The technology also allows for easy draining of the tub through voice or app commands. However, this luxury and convenience do come at a cost. The PerfectFill system is priced starting at $2,700 and requires professional installation. Despite the price tag, it is an investment that many customers may be willing to make for the convenience and effortless bathing experience it offers. In addition to PerfectFill, Kohler unveiled its Stillness Bath, which takes the bathing experience to a whole new level. This smart bathtub combines water, light, fog, and aroma to create a rejuvenating spa-like experience within the comforts of home. The Stillness Bath incorporates the PerfectFill technology and is available at a starting price of $8,000. Moreover, there is an Infinity Experience model available, which allows water to flow over the edges of the tub into a hinoki wood base, creating a soothing trickling waterfall sound. The entire system is controlled through the Kohler Konnect app, further enhancing the user experience. The lower-end freestanding bath will be available for purchase in Q1 2022, while other models will launch in Q3. Kohler also showcased its Purist Suspend, a revolutionary kitchen faucet that hangs from the ceiling. This unique design aims to reduce counter clutter and offers 180-degree rotation for added convenience. The Purist Suspend can be controlled using a waterproof, battery-operated Bluetooth puck, providing a seamless experience. The faucet is set to be available for purchase this year. Furthermore, Kohler introduced the H2Wise smart water monitor, developed in collaboration with Phyn. The H2Wise and H2Wise Plus (the professionally installed version) constantly monitor water usage throughout the house and are capable of detecting leaks. In the event of a leak, the H2Wise Plus can shut off the water supply through the app. Both units require a 110v/220v power supply and can be controlled using the Kohler Konnect app. Additionally, these smart water monitors can be paired with voice assistants for added convenience. Kohler also unveiled the Robern IQ Digital Lock Box, a high-tech solution for securely storing medication and personal items. Designed to fit inside a bathroom vanity cabinet, the smart lock box can be customized to fit any vanity space. Priced at $449, the Robern IQ Digital Lock Box features a touchpad panel and an accompanying app for password setting and protection. The app also allows users to view entry logs and receive alerts whenever the box is accessed. Users can even set schedules and receive medication reminders, providing an all-in-one solution for storage and organization. In the realm of touchless technology, Kohler is introducing a line of Touchless Residential Bathroom Faucets that can be easily activated with a wave of a hand. These faucets start at $199 and come with a twist top for temperature control. An auto shut-off feature ensures that the faucet stops flowing after two minutes, resulting in water conservation. Additionally, the faucet operates on batteries, simplifying the installation process. Lastly, Kohler announced the Power Reserve, a modular home energy storage system that pairs with solar power systems to store solar energy. The Power Reserve system can be controlled through the Kohler Power Reserve app, offering different modes, including backup, self-supply, time of use, and custom settings. The pricing for the Power Reserve starts at $13,325 for a 10kWh system, providing a sustainable and reliable energy storage solution for homeowners. With these innovative and high-tech offerings, Kohler continues to redefine the future of bathroom and kitchen experiences. The company's commitment to innovation and customer-centric design is evident in its range of products showcased at CES 2022.
