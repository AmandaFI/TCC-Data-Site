The end of gas-powered cars is looming as the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) prepares to announce new tailpipe emission standards phasing out gas-powered vehicles. The ambitious move is part of President Biden's vision for 50% of new car sales to be tailpipe emissions-free by 2030, and California's ruling that all new cars sold in the state must be free of carbon emissions by 2035. The EPA will mandate that two-thirds of vehicles sold by each automaker in the US will be electric vehicles (EVs) by 2032, marking the largest and most challenging transition in the 150-year history of the auto industry. The new EPA rules will set an emissions limit on the total number of new cars each automaker sells in a year and incentivize companies to build more EVs. Although some automakers have already shifted to EVs, plug-in vehicles remain a fraction of the overall car market in the US. The transition to EVs will require automakers to respond effectively to meet rapidly shifting consumer demand for electric cars. Failure to do so may cause them to fall rapidly behind. Many states have followed California's lead in setting their own deadlines to phase out the sale of gas-powered cars. However, President Biden is unlikely to issue an executive order that bans the sale of gas cars to avoid opening himself up to too much criticism. Reactions to the new EPA rules have been mixed, with automakers acknowledging the need to transition to EVs but voicing concerns about the timeline and potential impact on jobs. The United Auto Workers (UAW) union has warned that the shift to EVs could lead to job losses in the auto industry. In response, the Biden administration has proposed a $174 billion plan that includes incentives for consumers to buy EVs and funding for domestic battery production in an effort to create new jobs in the EV industry. Some experts argue that the transition to EVs is necessary to combat climate change and reduce air pollution, while others point out that the production of EVs also has a carbon footprint. Nonetheless, the growth of EVs is expected to reduce overall emissions from the transport sector. The timing of the new EPA rules coincides with several other significant developments in the EV industry. For example, Tesla's Model 3 recently became the best-selling car in the UK, overtaking popular gas-powered models like the Ford Fiesta and the Volkswagen Golf. In addition, General Motors (GM) recently announced its plan to launch 30 new EVs globally by 2025, with the goal of making its entire vehicle lineup electric by 2035. Overall, the new EPA rules represent a major step towards the end of gas-powered cars in the US. While the transition to EVs will undoubtedly be challenging for the auto industry, it is also an opportunity to create new jobs, reduce emissions, and improve air quality. As consumers become increasingly interested in EVs, automakers will need to adapt to meet the demand or risk falling behind their competitors.
