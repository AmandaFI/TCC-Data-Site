Amazon’s Latest Layoffs Cut 9,000 More Jobs in Divisions Including Twitch and AWS. Amazon has recently announced that it will lay off 9,000 more of its employees, including those in Amazon Web Services (AWS), Twitch, advertising, and human resources.. This plan is due to the “uncertain economy,” according to a memo from Amazon CEO, Andy Jassy. The company is trying to reduce costs and headcount by streamlining its operations in a bid to boost long-term customer experiences. This is the second round of layoffs for Amazon in recent months, following the company's move to let go of 18,000 employees late last year and in January. The newly announced layoffs have made Amazon's employees jittery, especially those working in the impacted divisions. Amazon has reportedly undergone several internal reshuffles, including the resignation of Twitch CEO, Emmett Shear, from his position. Recent changes have left some Twitch users feeling frustrated, with more significant changes said to be underway. Amazon is yet to announce the exact number of layoffs that will occur in each division. Impacted teams will make decisions on which employees to cut by mid to late April, according to reports. Affected employees are said to receive severance pay, transitional health insurance, and job placement support. The layoffs raise several questions about the future of AWS, Amazon's cloud computing division that generated about $45.4 billion in revenue for Amazon in 2020. AWS has been a key focus area for the company, accounting for nearly 12% of Amazon's total revenue. The division's recent layoffs are a cause for concern, especially when considering the growing competition from other cloud providers, including Microsoft and Google. The layoffs in advertising and human resources are also noticeable as the two departments account for a significant portion of Amazon's expenses. In recent years, Amazon has been ramping up its advertising business, and layoffs in this division could indicate a more reserved approach to the sector or a shift in focus elsewhere. This news of further layoffs comes amid Amazon's involvement in high-profile employee-related controversies. Fatigue, work-life balance, and sickness have been some of the major concerns raised by its couriers. Recently, more than 5,800 Amazon employees in Bessemer, Alabama, voted on whether to form Amazon's first U.S. union. The employees, mainly warehouse workers, truck drivers, and maintenance workers, are unionizing to improve working conditions at Amazon. The company's labor practices have come under scrutiny over the years, with several reports pointing to poor working conditions and long hours as major concerns. Amazon's workers earning minimum wage are said to depend on food banks to sustain themselves, while those earning slightly above minimum wage cannot afford health insurance. Amazon's quick response to the growing concerns has been to change its minimum wage policy and offer a $15 minimum hourly wage to all of its workers, including part-time and seasonal employees. However, concerns about working conditions persist, with unionizing seen as the only way for Amazon employees to gain a fair bargaining position. Amazon's recent layoffs raise a myriad of concerns for the employees involved, as well as for investors and industry analysts. However, the company has been known to move quick and adapt fast to different market conditions, as demonstrated by its recent pivot to cloud computing via AWS. As such, it remains to be seen how these latest layoffs will impact the company's overall strategy and bottom line.
