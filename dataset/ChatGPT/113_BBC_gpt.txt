Facebook users in the US can now claim their share of a $725m settlement following allegations that their data was shared without their explicit consent through third-party firms such as Cambridge Analytica. The settlement concerns 87 million users and is available to anyone who used Facebook in the US between 24 May 2007 and 22 December 2022. While Meta, Facebook's parent company, has denied any wrongdoing, it has agreed to the settlement. Claimants who qualify for the settlement will be awarded one point for each month they had a Facebook account during the "class period". The net settlement amount will be divided by the total number of points to determine how much money each claimant will receive. The settlement website is now open for users to claim their share, and claims can also be submitted via mail. The deadline for claims is 25 August. In 2018, Facebook faced a major scandal when it was revealed that the data of millions of users had been shared without their consent with political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica, which was used by the Trump campaign during the 2016 presidential election. The incident led to increased scrutiny over Facebook's data practices and calls for stronger regulation of tech companies. The settlement will have little impact on Meta in the short term, but repeated settlements may have a more serious effect. It is important to note that this settlement only covers US users, and the controversy over Facebook's data practices has also involved users outside of the US. Overall, the settlement highlights the importance of protecting user data and the need for greater transparency and accountability from tech companies when it comes to how they use and share personal data. While Facebook has made some changes to its data practices in recent years, the company will need to continue to adapt and improve its policies in order to regain user trust and avoid future scandals.
