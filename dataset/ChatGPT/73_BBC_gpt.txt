John Lewis considers plan to change staff-owned structure. John Lewis, one of the UK's leading retail groups, is evaluating the possibility of selling a minority stake in the business to raise funds for investment. The retailer, which is fully owned by its staff, is reportedly exploring the option of selling up to £2bn of equity in the business. The move could help finance innovative technology such as data analysis, as well as support Waitrose's supply chain. Traditionally, John Lewis employees are known for owning the business, and the company is considered one of the few successful examples of employee ownership in the UK. Under the current model, staff members receive a share of the company's profits each year. The model has proved successful, and many employees have enjoyed substantial windfalls over the years. However, the pandemic has taken its toll on the company, with a loss of £234m in revenue during 2022-23. The company has also faced challenges from the cost of living crisis. In response, John Lewis is exploring alternative funding options, which include selling a minority stake to an outside investor. Despite the reports, John Lewis has not yet confirmed the plans. If the company pursues this path, it would represent a significant shift for the organization's ownership structure. Employee ownership is seen as a key part of the John Lewis company culture and could impact staff morale. Commenting on the news, Professor Colin Mayer, Peter Moores Professor of Management Studies at Saïd Business School, University of Oxford, said: "Employee ownership is one of the great strengths of John Lewis. If this step is considered, the aim must be to create the right balance between raising capital for growth and preserving the special character and values of the company.". The news has coincided with reports of a significant revamp of John Lewis' operations, which includes the closure of some stores and the sale of Waitrose's magazine business. The company has also announced plans to expand its digital presence, with the introduction of virtual try-on technology for clothing. For John Lewis, the challenges posed by the pandemic provide an opportunity to re-evaluate the company's operations. A minority stake sale could be an opportunity to accelerate growth, but it remains to be seen whether the company will follow this path. For the time being, the focus will be on preserving the company's culture and values while exploring funding options to support the next stage of growth.
