Tinder, the popular dating app used by millions of individuals globally, has announced a new update to its photo verification process, which utilises artificial intelligence (AI) technology and video selfies to enhance its user safety measures. Prior to the release of the AI and video verification feature, users would upload a photo to prove their identity, with the app then verifying it. However, the latest update announced on Wednesday will require users to produce a video selfie that will then be analysed by AI to confirm the identity of the user, which Tinder claims will help remove spammers and fake profiles. This technology will require users to submit a series of selfies in real-time, which will be audited by Tinder's AI system to match them to their profile picture. Once the match is confirmed, the user's profile will receive a blue checkmark badge. With the introduction of this new feature, the dating app aims to ensure users feel secure when using its platform. The company explained in a statement that the update was part of a broader push to increase safety for its users as it tries to demonstrate that it is a reliable platform. Tinder's Head of Trust and Safety Product, Rory Kozoll, said in a statement: "Every day, millions of our members trust us to introduce them to new people, and we're dedicated to building innovative safety features powered by best-in-class technology that meet the needs of today's daters.". This update to the photo verification process will also enable the app to restrict chats between verified users only, eliminating the possibility of fraudulent or misleading accounts. This feature is expected to be rolled out in the coming months. While the new update could be viewed by some as an invasion of privacy, Tinder insists that user data will be kept confidential and not shared with any third-party companies. To protect users' data, Tinder said it would store verification data for only 30 days, while users will be given the option to delete their verification videos permanently. The introduction of video technology follows after Tinder conducted research that showed it was more secure to introduce video selfies rather than simple photos. According to the dating app, the AI powered video verification feature will have a 100% accuracy rate in the detection of fake profiles. This move follows in the footsteps of other major dating apps pushing for more safety and security. In 2019, Match, the dating app giant which owns Tinder, announced a partnership with a non-profit company called "Garbo", aimed at conducting more detailed background checks on its users. While the new feature may create a barrier for those looking to create fake profiles, it will also likely reduce the number of apps being used for dating. It could also lead to users being more cautious and slow to join the platform, despite measures created to authenticate users. . Tinder's Head of Safety insisted that such actions are necessary to ensure the company lives up to users' safety expectations. "Our users deserve the best protection we can provide, as well as the freedom to safely explore and express themselves," Kozoll said. In summary, Tinder's new photo verification process using AI and video selfies aims to offer a more reliable and robust way of identifying users as the app introduces more safety features to protect its users. Despite the contentious nature of such updates on privacy matters, Tinder maintains that users will have control over their data and guarantees confidentiality.
