Elon Musk, the tech entrepreneur known for his ventures in space exploration and electric cars, has founded a new artificial intelligence (AI) company called X.AI, according to a filing with the state of Nevada. Reportedly listed as director, Musk is not new to AI ventures, having co-founded OpenAI, a Microsoft-supported AI firm back in 2015. While little is known about X.AI's immediate plans, rumours have emerged that the company could compete with Musk's former venture, OpenAI. Recently, he reportedly bought thousands of graphic processing units which are expected to power an upcoming generative AI product. The purchase has led to speculation that Musk might create an AI firm that would compete with the Microsoft-backed OpenAI. . Jared Birchall, director of the entrepreneurâ€™s family office, is listed as the secretary of the new firm. Other than this, not much information is available on the company's website, which carries the brief bio: "At X.AI, we build artificial intelligence products for businesses mainly focused on improving productivity.". Many industry insiders welcomed the creation of X.AI and praised the potential impact the new firm could have. AI is the future, and companies in this space are in high demand due to the potential for growth in this sector. Thus, many investors expect X.AI to be of interest, with some even stating that it could become a game-changer. . The Wall Street Journal and Financial Times have reportedly been among the first to report on the founding of X.AI. However, neither has provided any further details on what the company could be working on, or what problems it aims to solve. . This isn't the first time Elon Musk has taken an unconventional approach to creating something groundbreaking. The serial entrepreneur has made his mark on a wide range of industries, including electric cars, tunneling, and space travel. Now with X.AI, he appears to be exploring yet another challenging feat - the development of innovative AI technologies that can be applied in the real world.
