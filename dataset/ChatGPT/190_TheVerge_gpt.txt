Fringe YouTubers are finding alternative ways to profit from their controversial channels, according to a new study conducted by researchers at Cornell Tech and the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne. The study, which analyzed over 71 million English language videos from 136,000 YouTube channels, discovered that YouTubers who produce alt-right and anti-feminist content are actively promoting other income streams off-platform. The researchers found that channels showcasing problematic content were more likely to engage in alternative monetization methods, such as requesting cash donations, selling products, and participating in affiliate marketing. This indicates that demonetization alone is not an effective strategy in discouraging the production of controversial content. In fact, the study suggests that demonetization may inadvertently lead to an increase in the creation of such content. Surprisingly, nearly two-thirds of the analyzed channels included appeals for alternative income streams. This prevalence of off-platform monetization efforts highlights the extent to which YouTubers rely on these methods to support their content creation. Furthermore, the study revealed a positive correlation between the adoption of alternative monetization methods and increased content creation. This suggests that YouTubers who generate income through off-platform sources are more inclined to create a higher volume of content. The findings of the study raise important questions about the effectiveness of demonetization as a tool for discouraging fringe content. The researchers argue that platforms need to consider the wider impact of creators' off-platform income streams when crafting moderation policies. Merely removing monetization options may not be enough to deter content creators, and alternative income methods could contribute to the persistence of controversial content. Transparency from platforms is also a significant concern. The researchers stress the need for greater openness to understand which types of content are favored and who is profiting. This valuable insight could help shape policies that effectively discourage fringe content while preserving freedom of expression. YouTube has faced increasing scrutiny in recent years due to controversies surrounding the presence of extremist and controversial content on its platform. While the company has implemented measures to demonetize channels that violate its guidelines, critics argue that more needs to be done to address the broader issue of fringe content. The study's findings shed light on the complex relationship between monetization, content creation, and moderation policies. It emphasizes the need for platforms to adopt a multi-faceted approach that goes beyond demonetization to effectively address problematic and controversial content online. As platforms continue to navigate the challenges of content moderation, researchers and advocates hope that this study will encourage a reevaluation of current policies. With greater transparency and consideration for off-platform income streams, platforms can strive to strike the balance between freedom of expression and responsible content creation.
