Ukraine war 'catastrophic for global food'. The ongoing war in Ukraine is set to have far-reaching consequences on the global supply and cost of food, according to the CEO of Yara International, one of the world's largest fertilizer companies. With disruptions to supply chains caused by the conflict, the availability of essential raw materials used in fertilizer production is at risk. This, coupled with already soaring fertilizer prices due to wholesale gas price increases, spells trouble for the global food market. Both Russia and Ukraine are major players in the agriculture and food sector and also vital producers of key ingredients in fertilizers. The CEO of Yara International warns that if fertilizer supply is severely disrupted, crop yields could plummet by 50%, resulting in a potential global food crisis. The impact of the conflict has already hit Yara International, as one of their offices in Kyiv was targeted by a missile. Furthermore, the shipping industry's disruptions have made it increasingly difficult for the company to secure deliveries. Adding to these challenges, the Russian government's recent plea for producers to stop exporting fertilizers only compounds the difficulties faced by Yara International. Analysts predict that these disruptions will lead to higher costs for farmers and lower crop yields, resulting in even higher costs for food. Additionally, natural gas plays a vital role in fertilizer production, and Yara International heavily relies on Russian gas for its European plants. Last year, the company had to suspend production due to a spike in wholesale gas prices, which, combined with sanctions on Belarus and extreme weather events, led to an increase in fertilizer prices and subsequently food prices. While Yara International is continuously working to find ways to ensure supply, it is essential for the world to reduce its dependency on Russia for global food production. The CEO emphasizes that the war in Ukraine is yet another catastrophe on top of existing challenges faced by the global food production system, which includes climate change and growing populations. The impact of the conflict will disproportionately affect poorer countries and further exacerbate food insecurity. The ramifications of the conflict in Ukraine are extensive, with the global food market being particularly vulnerable. The disruption in the supply of essential raw materials for fertilizer production not only threatens crop yields but also poses a significant risk to food security. Yara International's warning serves as a wake-up call, highlighting the urgent need for diversification of supply chains and reducing reliance on Russia in the global food production system. To mitigate the impact of the crisis, governments and organizations must prioritize investment in sustainable agriculture practices and explore alternative sources of essential fertilizer ingredients. This is crucial not only to ensure a steady and affordable food supply but also to protect vulnerable populations from the consequences of food scarcity and insecurity. In the face of various challenges, including climate change, population growth, and now conflict, a comprehensive and proactive approach is needed to safeguard the global food supply and prevent a devastating food crisis.
