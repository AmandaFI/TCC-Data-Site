Bionic eyes: Obsolete tech leaves patients in the dark. Hundreds of individuals with retinal implants are facing uncertainty as the technology they rely on becomes obsolete. Second Sight, the company behind the Argus II bionic eyes, stopped producing the implants several years ago to focus on a brain implant instead. Now, as Second Sight aims to merge with a biopharmaceutical firm that does not produce eye implants, patients fear that their needs will be neglected. The CEO of Second Sight has acknowledged the concerns raised by the discontinuation of the Argus II, but has stated that he will only address them after the merger is completed. This lack of urgency has left patients feeling neglected and anxious about their future. While the Argus II is still promoted on Second Sight's website for its numerous benefits, including improved mobility and independence for those with vision impairment, limited support is being offered to the roughly 350 individuals with the implant. The company's financial difficulties only exacerbate the situation. In 2020, Second Sight came close to bankruptcy, and its focus on the Orion brain device, which provides artificial vision, further detracted attention and resources from the Argus II. Patients have expressed frustration over the lack of communication from Second Sight during this challenging period. One patient described themselves and others with the implant as being "figuratively and literally in the dark.". The lack of support from Second Sight has become painfully evident for some patients. One individual encountered difficulties when their VPU system broke, and despite reaching out to the company, they received no assistance. Second Sight has since contacted users and doctors, promising virtual support. However, repairs or replacements for the implants are not viable options for the company. The Argus II implant system involves a complex arrangement of components, including an implanted electrode array behind the retina, special glasses with a built-in camera, and a video processing unit (VPU) attached to the wearer's waist. The camera captures video, which is then transmitted to the VPU, where it is converted into black and white pixels. These pixel patterns are wirelessly transmitted to an antenna on the outside of the eye, stimulating flashes of light that correspond to the video feed. The technology is both intricate and expensive, estimated to cost around $150,000, excluding surgery and post-surgery training. However, concerns have been raised about the vulnerability and ethical considerations surrounding such high-tech medical devices. These devices heavily rely on software upgrades, proprietary methods, and for-profit ventures, leaving patients vulnerable if a company shifts its focus away from a particular technology. The discontinuation of the Argus II highlights the potential risks associated with cutting-edge medical devices, as patients are left unsure of the future of their vision improvement. Advocates argue that more safeguards need to be put in place to protect patients who rely on these advanced technologies. A lack of communication and support from companies like Second Sight can have profound effects on the lives of those who depend on these implants. Additionally, the exorbitant cost of the Argus II further compounds the issue, making the situation even more dire for patients who find themselves left in the dark, both metaphorically and literally. As developments in the field of medical technology continue to advance, it is crucial for companies to consider the long-term implications of their products and the impact on the lives of patients. The convergence of profit-driven ventures and cutting-edge medical devices raises ethical questions that must be addressed to prevent patients from being abandoned when technology becomes obsolete.
