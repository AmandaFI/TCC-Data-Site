Sealed, a Manhattan-based startup, has secured an additional $29.5 million in funding to assist homeowners in transitioning from oil and gas heating systems to more energy-efficient heat pumps. The investment was led by property-tech investor Fifth Wall, alongside prominent investors such as Robert Downey Jr.'s FootPrint Coalition and CityRock. Sealed's financing model covers the upfront costs of installation and weatherization, with homeowners subsequently billed on a monthly basis for the energy savings achieved. The company leverages the power of machine learning algorithms to predict a home's future energy consumption. With the fresh funding, Sealed plans to expand its operations beyond the Northeastern United States, beginning with a launch in Chicago. Additionally, the startup aims to double its workforce to approximately 200 employees by the end of this year. The recent financing brings Sealed's series B funding to a total of $45.5 million. The main objective of Sealed is to encourage the adoption of sustainable and energy-efficient heating solutions, reducing the reliance on oil and gas. Heat pumps are an eco-friendly alternative that utilize renewable energy sources, thereby significantly curbing carbon emissions. Heating systems powered by oil and gas are not only detrimental to the environment but also costly for homeowners. Sealed offers a unique solution by shouldering the upfront expenses associated with transitioning to heat pumps. Homeowners are then billed based on the energy saved. This innovative financing model makes the transition to green heating systems more accessible and affordable for a broader range of homeowners. By optimizing the energy usage of homes through machine learning-powered algorithms, Sealed ensures that the transition is both economically viable and environmentally sustainable. The algorithms analyze a home's energy consumption patterns, enabling Sealed to predict future energy usage accurately. This allows the company to guarantee energy savings, eliminating any financial risk for homeowners in the process. Sealed's expansion beyond the Northeastern United States signifies the success it has achieved in its mission to accelerate the decarbonization of homes. By venturing into new markets, starting with Chicago, Sealed aims to spread the adoption of energy-efficient heating solutions, revolutionizing the way homes are heated across the nation. The new funding, which includes notable investors like Robert Downey Jr.'s FootPrint Coalition, further validates Sealed's innovative approach in the sustainable energy sector. Sealed has gained recognition for its unique financing model and successful deployments across the Northeast. With this funding, the startup is poised to continue its growth trajectory and create a positive impact on the environment. Sealed's commitment to the environment aligns with the global push for sustainable living and reducing carbon emissions. As more homeowners embrace energy-efficient heating solutions, the collective impact on the environment will be substantial. By easing the financial burden associated with transitioning to green heating, Sealed is paving the way for a greener future, one home at a time.
