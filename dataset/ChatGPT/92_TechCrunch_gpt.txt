The California Civil Rights Department (CRD) is seeking a court order to force Tesla to comply with an investigation into allegations of racial bias and harassment against black workers. The investigation was launched after the CRD received complaints from black employees at the company, citing the use of racial slurs, racist writing, and graffiti in the workplace. Tesla was subpoenaed for a deposition in March but failed to comply, stating that there wasn't enough time to locate the witness. The CRD has requested that Tesla pay $1,425 in attorney fees and is seeking an order to show why Tesla hasn't "responded fully to the investigative discovery". Tesla has previously tried to pause the lawsuit, to have the case dismissed and to petition against the CRD for allegedly failing to conduct proper investigations, but all attempts have been denied. Tesla has been embroiled in a series of allegations of racial discrimination and harassment against its black employees. A judge recently ordered the carmaker to pay $3.2m to a black former worker at its Fremont factory. The California Supreme Court has also allowed minority workers at the same plant to seek a court order requiring Tesla to address a climate of racial discrimination. The investigation into Tesla's alleged discrimination and harassment practices is ongoing, and the CRD is determined to ensure that the company fully complies with the investigation. The CRD believes that Tesla's refusal to cooperate with the investigation is a violation of California law and is seeking a court order to force the company to comply. It is not the first time that Tesla has been accused of failing to address racial bias and harassment in the workplace. In 2017, a former employee filed a lawsuit against the company alleging that he was subjected to racial harassment and discrimination by supervisors and coworkers. The employee alleged that he was called the N-word by coworkers on a regular basis and was fired after complaining about the harassment. The lawsuit was settled out of court, and the terms of the settlement were not disclosed. The allegations of racial bias and harassment against Tesla are a significant challenge for the company, which has positioned itself as a leader in the fight against climate change and as a champion of diversity and inclusion in the tech industry. Tesla has previously described the allegations as "unfounded" and has said that it takes any allegations of discrimination seriously. The company has also implemented a number of measures to address diversity and inclusion in the workplace in recent years, including the appointment of more women and people of color to leadership roles. However, the ongoing investigation and the recent court ruling against the company suggest that there are still significant issues that need to be addressed. In a statement, the CRD said: "The California Civil Rights Department will not tolerate any form of unlawful discrimination, harassment, or bias in the workplace. We expect all employers in California to comply fully with state anti-discrimination laws and to take action to address any concerns or complaints.". The CRD's legal action against Tesla is just the latest example of the growing movement to hold tech companies accountable for issues of diversity and inclusion in the workplace. Last year, Google faced a similar lawsuit over allegations of gender discrimination and harassment, while Facebook was accused of allowing advertisers to discriminate against users based on their race. The tech industry has long struggled with issues of diversity and inclusion, with many companies' workforces remaining largely dominated by white men. However, there are growing efforts to address these issues, with initiatives such as the Tech Equity Collaborative and the Black Tech Mecca Foundation working to promote diversity and inclusion in the tech sector. In the case of Tesla, the ongoing investigation and legal action highlight the need for companies to take allegations of discrimination and harassment seriously and to take concrete steps to address these issues in the workplace. Only by doing so can tech companies truly live up to their ideals of diversity, inclusion, and social responsibility.
