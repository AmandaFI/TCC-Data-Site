Climate tech deal-making experienced a significant slowdown in the first quarter of 2020, with a 36% decrease in deals compared to the previous year, according to a report by PitchBook. The report also shows a drop in investment value from $8.9 billion in 2019 to $5.7 billion this year. . While some experts believe climate tech remains a stable investment, the drop in activity may indicate a correction in the market. Investors have been making deals in the climate tech sector, while slowing down investment in other tech sectors. . PitchBook's report also shows that the majority of investments during the first quarter went towards later-stage companies, with the average deal size increasing to $24.3 million. . The report highlights that transportation remains the dominant subsector within climate tech, making up nearly 30% of all investments. Energy generation, storage and distribution accounted for 22% of all investments. While agriculture and food tech, waste and recycling, and industrial goods and services saw the smallest amount of investment. . The COVID-19 pandemic has had an impact on all sectors and climate tech has not been immune. Potential investors are reconsidering their options, focusing on investments that offer immediate returns and are more stable in the current economic climate. . Despite the slowdown, there have been some notable deals in the first quarter of 2020. The largest was a $1 billion investment in Fortum Oslo Varme, a district heating system in Oslo, Norway powered by energy recovery from waste. Another large deal was Enel's $495 million investment in Mainstream Renewable Power, a renewable energy company focused on wind and solar projects. . With continued global uncertainty, it remains to be seen whether the slowdown will continue in the climate tech market. However, some experts predict that the sector will continue to grow and be a stable investment, especially as governments and companies around the world strive to reach net-zero emissions. . A climate tech investor noted, "It's too early to say what the long-term implications of COVID-19 will be for climate tech. But we're confident that the world needs solutions to climate change and we're here to support the companies doing so.".
