Headphone startup Nura has been acquired by Masimo Corporation, a Southern California medical device firm. Nura is an Australian audio technology provider known for its customisable audio profiles, which adapts to the listener's hearing and creates a unique sound experience. Masimo plans to incorporate this technology into its Adaptive Acoustic Technology platform to bring personalised audio to more customers globally. The acquisition amount has not been disclosed. . Masimo already owns popular audio brands such as Bowers and Wilkins, Polk Audio and Denon. The company acquired these brands when it bought Sound United last year. With the addition of Nura to its portfolio, Masimo aims to offer consumers a more comprehensive audio experience. . The Nura brand, however, is expected to be phased out and existing products are only supported through their warranty period. This means that Masimo's Adaptive Acoustic Technology platform will be the primary focus of the company's audio offerings moving forward. . Nura's acquisition is seen as an acqui-hire, where a company is acquired primarily for the talent it brings onboard. Nura's team is composed of engineers, scientists, and audiophiles who design and develop audio electronics with advanced software. This acquisition will enhance Masimo's existing team and accelerate development of its Adaptive Acoustic Technology platform. Masimo CEO Joe Kiani stated that "Our focus has always been on improving people's lives through innovative solutions. Nura's technology provides a personalised listening experience that aligns perfectly with our mission. We're thrilled to welcome them to the Masimo family." . Nura's CEO, Dragan Petrovic, also expressed excitement about the acquisition, saying, "We're proud of the technology we've built and the team we've assembled at Nura. We've always been committed to making great sound accessible to everyone and we believe Masimo's vision aligns perfectly with ours. Joining Masimo is an exciting next step for us.". The audio industry is highly competitive, and the demand for personalised user experience continues to grow. With the incorporation of Nura's technology, Masimo aims to position itself as a leader in customisable audio, providing a differentiated offering to consumers. Masimo's Adaptive Acoustic Technology platform leverages the company's expertise in medical devices to deliver a high-fidelity audio experience that's customised to the listener's hearing. The platform uses a noninvasive method to measure hearing sensitivity in real-time, allowing the system to adapt sound output to the user's needs. . The platform is often used in healthcare settings to provide personalised audio to patients during procedures. Through Nura's acquisition, Masimo plans to expand the platform's reach beyond medical applications and offer customisable audio profiles to a wider audience. As the acquisition is finalised, the future of Nura's existing products remains uncertain. However, Masimo plans to continue supporting them throughout their warranty period. The company's focus now is to ramp up development of its existing platform, incorporating Nura's expertise and technology to enhance its capabilities. . For audiophiles and music enthusiasts, personalised audio is the next frontier, and with Masimo's acquisition of Nura, it looks like they will soon be able to enjoy a highly customised audio experience that adapts to their individual hearing profile.
