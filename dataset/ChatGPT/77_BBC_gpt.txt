Richard Branson's satellite launch company, Virgin Orbit, has filed for bankruptcy in the US after failing to secure new investment. The California-based company that launched rockets from modified Boeing 747s to send satellites into space has halted operations since last month, with the hope of finding a buyer for the business. The company had debts of $153.5m as of September last year. . Virgin Orbit's bankruptcy comes after a failed attempt earlier this year to launch a satellite from the UK. The rockeffailed to complete its first-ever satellite launch from the UK due to a fuel filter issue. Although the company was previously the leading candidate for a Department of Defense contract, it lost out to its rival, Elon Musk's SpaceX. The firm was also forced to cut 85% of its 750-strong workforce last week as part of its efforts to stay afloat. The company's business model was to launch satellites for entities such as universities, governments, and private companies from the air, avoiding the need to build costly launchpads. The idea behind this was to make space tourism more accessible to the general public. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has forced much of the world to roll back activities causing an economic downturn that has hit the financing of several businesses, including that of Virgin Orbit. Despite the current economic downturn, Virgin Galactic, Branson's space tourism company, remains strongly positioned in the market. The company has already completed two successful test flights that took it beyond the Earth's atmosphere earlier this year. Branson, who founded Virgin Orbit in 2017, had tried to maintain a positive outlook for the company until it was clear that it could no longer survive. Branson expressed "deep, deep sadness" at the collapse of the firm but stated that he would "continue to push the boundaries of commercial space flight and bring space closer." Virgin Orbit's collapse marks a significant blow for the billionaire's endeavors in the space industry. The company's bankruptcy is a reminder of the risks involved in the commercial space flight industry, which has seen significant investments in recent years. SpaceX is the largest and most well-known space exploration company, having already set up an international space station resupply service and arranging to launch full crew expeditions to the International Space Station in 2021. Meanwhile, Blue Origin, founded by Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, is working towards flying passengers to space on its New Shepard rockets. Branson's Virgin companies have not always been successes. The conglomerate's music and movie businesses also faced challenges from increased digital streaming and downloads. Virgin America, Branson's airline venture, was ultimately sold to Alaska Airlines. The failure of Virgin Orbit will no doubt prove a disappointment for Branson and his team, but it serves as a stark reminder of the risks involved in the industry. With new entrants like SpaceX and Blue Origin and more established names like Boeing and Lockheed Martin, companies in the space industry will need to be strategic and careful in their business models to thrive in the market. Despite the difficulties faced in the space industry, Branson remains undeterred, with further plans for space tourism through Virgin Galactic. The company seeks to allow space tourists to experience a few minutes of weightlessness and breathtaking views of the Earth. With this venture, the billionaire hopes to create a thriving space tourism industry in the years to come. It remains to be seen whether the company will succeed in this new venture or if Virgin Orbit's bankruptcy will have a lasting impact on Richard Branson's other business ventures.
