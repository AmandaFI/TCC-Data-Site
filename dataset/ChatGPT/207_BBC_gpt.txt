Truth Social: Banned from Twitter, Trump returns with a new platform. Former US President Donald Trump has made a comeback to the social media world with his own platform, Truth Social. The app, currently available in a limited form on the US Apple App Store, is drawing comparisons to Twitter. This move comes after Trump was banned from Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube last year. However, early users of the platform have faced registration difficulties, with some even being placed on a waitlist due to the high demand. Project lead and former congressman Devin Nunes assures users that the app will be fully operational by the end of March. Trump Media & Technology Group, the creator of Truth Social, had previously tested the platform with approximately 500 beta testers. The launch of Truth Social has generated excitement and curiosity among Donald Trump's supporters, who are eager to engage with the former president on this new social network. Last week, Donald Trump Jr shared his father's first "truth" post on the platform, indicating that they plan to actively interact with users. The contents and engagement strategies of Truth Social are yet to be fully revealed, but many are expecting Trump's distinctive communication style and unfiltered content to be major features on the platform. While it remains to be seen how Truth Social will fare in the competitive social media landscape, the platform's launch signifies Trump's determination to regain his online presence and connect with his supporters directly.
