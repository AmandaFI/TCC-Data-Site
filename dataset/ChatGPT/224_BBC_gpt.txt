Zuckerberg reveals AI projects to power Metaverse. Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Meta, formerly known as Facebook, has unveiled several ambitious artificial intelligence (AI) projects aimed at advancing the development of the "Metaverse". In a livestreamed demonstration, Zuckerberg showcased a new AI feature called Builder Bot, which allows the creation of basic virtual worlds. He also announced plans to develop a universal speech translator and emphasized the company's commitment to privacy, transparency, and responsibility in AI systems. Zuckerberg demonstrated the capabilities of Builder Bot by creating a virtual world that included an island, trees, and a beach. The AI feature is part of Meta's CAIRaoke project, which aims to enhance AI assistants and enable them to perceive virtual reality from a human perspective. Privacy and responsibility were highlighted as key principles guiding Meta's AI systems. With world-renowned AI expert Yann LeCun as Meta's head of AI, the company has been investing in AI for years. Earlier this year, Meta announced the development of an AI supercomputer, aiming to create the fastest one in the world. Meta's main objective is to construct the Metaverse, an interconnected virtual reality space accessible through devices like the Meta Quest VR headset. To support this ambitious project, the company plans to hire 10,000 employees in Europe. However, critics have expressed concerns about the influence of big corporations in shaping the Metaverse and the safety of users within these digital environments. Roger McNamee, an early investor in Facebook, voiced apprehension about Meta's role in creating a potentially "dystopian" Metaverse, considering Facebook's history of mishandling user data and failing to combat misinformation and hate speech. Meta's chief technology officer, Andrew Bosworth, acknowledged the challenges in moderating the Metaverse, but assured users that they would have control over their experiences. In response to reports of harassment in Meta's VR platform, Horizon Worlds, the company has introduced a feature called Personal Boundary to safeguard users from unwanted interactions. Meta's announcement of AI projects and its commitment to privacy, responsibility, and transparency in the development of the Metaverse have evoked both excitement and concerns. The future of virtual reality and user safety is at the forefront of discussions surrounding Meta's ambitious plans. The impact of Meta's AI advancements and its initiatives to shape the Metaverse will undoubtedly shape the future of virtual reality and redefine the way people interact and communicate in digital spaces. Balancing the potential benefits of these developments with the concerns surrounding privacy and user safety will be crucial in creating a Metaverse that is inclusive, secure, and beneficial for all users.
