After GoFundMe, Rob Solomon is flying a $200M Kite in the land of commerce. Rob Solomon, the former CEO and chairman of crowdfunding site GoFundMe, has returned to the digital commerce industry as co-founder and CEO of Kite, a commerce company that aims to invest in and operate consumer product brands. Kite has received $200m in equity funding from Juxtapose and Blackstone to acquire existing brands and provide capital and operational support to enable them to expand their businesses beyond e-commerce. Kite aims to build a tech stack that leverages artificial intelligence and API technology to improve manufacturing, supply chain, design and customer acquisition. The company has already acquired several undisclosed businesses in the fitness and self-improvement categories. The move comes at a time when e-commerce sales are skyrocketing due to the pandemic, and the industry is experiencing a significant shift towards a more sustainable future, with more eco-friendly and social-conscious brands emerging. "Kite is taking a unique approach to commerce by investing in and operating established brands that have a meaningful connection with consumers but that may not have been able to break through the noise and reach their full potential," said Solomon. "We want to provide the support and resources these brands need to thrive and evolve beyond e-commerce, whilst also driving innovation in the industry through our tech stack.". Juxtapose and Blackstone both expressed their confidence in Solomon's ability to lead the company to success. "Rob has an unparalleled understanding of the digital commerce landscape and a proven track record of driving growth and innovation in the space," said Eric Boucher, co-CEO of Juxtapose. Kite already has a strong team in place, including former executives from companies such as Amazon, Walmart, and Procter & Gamble. The team is focused on using technology to drive efficiencies and improve the customer experience, while also investing in marketing and customer acquisition to increase brand awareness and reach new audiences. The company is also committed to sustainability, with plans to work with brands to address environmental and social issues, such as reducing waste and carbon emissions and promoting fair labor practices. Kite has already acquired several businesses in the fitness and self-improvement categories, although specific details have not been disclosed. These acquisitions were made in part due to the increased demand for health and wellness products during the pandemic. Kite's unique approach to commerce, which combines investments in established brands with a focus on innovation and sustainability, has already attracted attention from both investors and consumers. With $200m in funding, a talented team, and a commitment to doing good, Kite is poised to make a significant impact in the industry. . "We believe that Kite has the potential to transform the way we think about commerce, putting consumers and sustainability at the heart of everything they do," said Boucher. "We're excited to be a part of this journey and can't wait to see what the future holds.".
