Bolt, the Estonian startup known for its ride-hailing services, has successfully raised €628 million ($709 million) in its latest funding round, giving the company a valuation of €7.4 billion ($8.4 billion). This significant investment will be used to expand its transportation and food delivery services across new markets, improve its popular "super app," and develop new business lines, including its 15-minute grocery delivery service called Bolt Market. Bolt, previously known as Taxify, was originally founded eight years ago with the aim of providing ride-hailing services to emerging markets where Uber had yet to establish a strong presence. However, the company's success and strong growth have allowed it to expand across Europe and Africa and even compete in more developed markets as well. Currently, Bolt operates in over 45 countries and more than 400 cities, boasting a customer base of over 100 million users. Despite the challenges faced by competitors during the COVID-19 pandemic, Bolt has managed to not only survive but thrive, with revenues more than doubling compared to pre-pandemic levels. Markus Villig, the founder and CEO of Bolt, credits the company's success to its strategic diversification strategy, offering multiple services within a single app. This approach has not only attracted new customers but also reduced marketing costs significantly. Bolt's "super app" not only encompasses ride-hailing services but also shared cars and scooters, as well as restaurant and grocery delivery. With the new funds raised, Bolt plans to expand its grocery delivery service by building "dark stores" in more cities. Currently, Bolt Market offers fast grocery delivery in ten cities, and this business line has shown enormous potential for growth. The company believes that by expanding its "dark stores" and focusing on providing a convenient 15-minute grocery delivery service, it can tap into an untapped market and further strengthen its position in the industry. Moreover, Bolt aims to strengthen its partnerships with city governments to expand its services in line with updated transportation strategies. By collaborating with authorities, Bolt hopes to offer a superior alternative to private vehicle ownership and contribute to a more sustainable and efficient transportation system in cities worldwide. Sequoia Capital and Fidelity Management and Research Company co-led the recent funding round, with participation from other notable backers. The investors recognized Bolt's solid performance and growth potential, making it an attractive opportunity for funding. Bolt's ride-hailing business continues to experience double-digit growth, while its newer services are expanding at a faster rate. The company has managed to attract and retain drivers by offering better commissions than its competitors. This driver-focused approach has not only ensured an ample supply of drivers but has also resulted in high-quality service for customers. Looking ahead, Bolt plans to leverage the synergies and shared costs between its various verticals to provide savings for customers. By using its existing infrastructure and resources efficiently, the company aims to offer affordable services without compromising on quality. With its latest funding round, Bolt is well-positioned to continue its expansion and solidify its position as a leader in the transportation and food delivery industry. The company has proven its ability to adapt and grow in an ever-evolving market, and its success during the pandemic showcases its resilience and determination. With its "super app" and diversified services, Bolt is set to revolutionize the way people move around and access essential goods in the future.
