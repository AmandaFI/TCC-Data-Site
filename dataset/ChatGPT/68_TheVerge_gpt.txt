Utah Governor, Spencer Cox, has signed a series of new laws that require under-18s to obtain parental consent before using social media platforms. The measures also prohibit those under the age of 18 from using social media between 10:30 PM and 6:30 AM and stop companies from using features that could create addictive behavior in minors. Utah has become the first state in the US to introduce such legislation, which is set to take effect on March 1, 2024. The move has sparked controversy among tech industry lobbyists and civil liberties groups, who claim that the new laws infringe on free speech under the First Amendment. Governor Cox defended the legislation, stating that it aims to protect children from online predators, cyberbullying, and addiction to social media. He hailed the laws as a “common-sense solution” that would help parents protect their children from the dangers of social media. Under the new laws, social media platforms will have to provide clear disclosure of the data they collect on minors and how it is used and shared. Parents will have to provide explicit consent before their children can create social media accounts. The laws also require social media companies to implement measures that will prevent minors from being exposed to harmful content or interactions, such as cyberbullying. The prohibition on social media use between 10:30 PM and 6:30 AM is intended to reduce the negative impact that excessive social media use can have on sleep patterns and mental health. The laws specify that social media companies must implement automatic time limits that will limit children's use of their platforms. In addition, social media companies are prohibited from using features designed to create addictive behavior, such as autoplay, push notifications, and infinite scrolling. The companies must also provide tools for parents to monitor their children's social media use and set limits on their access. The legislation has been welcomed by child safety advocates, who have long been concerned about the risks associated with children's access to social media. They see the new laws as a step toward greater protection for children online and applaud the efforts of Utah lawmakers to address the issue. However, tech industry lobbyists and civil liberties groups have voiced their opposition to the legislation, arguing that it could have far-reaching implications for free speech and privacy rights. They claim that the laws are unconstitutional and could result in legal challenges from social media companies. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has expressed concern over the legislation, arguing that it undermines parents' rights to make decisions about their children's use of the internet and social media. The group also claims that the new laws could lead to censorship and limit teenagers' access to important information and resources. Some business insiders have criticized the timing of the legislation, which comes more than two years after it was first proposed. They claim that the fast-moving nature of the tech industry could make it difficult to enforce the new laws effectively. Despite the challenges ahead, Utah lawmakers are optimistic that the new laws will help to protect children from the dangers of social media. Governor Cox has urged parents to be proactive in monitoring their children's social media use and to take advantage of the tools and resources that the new legislation provides. As the first state in the US to take such a drastic step, Utah's new laws are being closely watched by lawmakers and advocates across the country. Social media companies are expected to challenge the regulations, and the outcome could have far-reaching implications for the future of online privacy and free speech.
