Ford has introduced a new system that uses robots to operate 3D printers without human help. The automaker's Advanced Manufacturing Center has developed an interface that allows machines from different suppliers to communicate and operate parts of the production line autonomously. This groundbreaking development solves a major bottleneck by using robots to operate 3D printers overnight, eliminating the need for human interaction. It also marks the first time that Carbon 3D printers and KUKA-built robots can communicate in the same language, presenting possibilities for collaboration throughout the production process. As of now, Ford's system has been instrumental in producing custom car parts like the brake line bracket for the Mustang Shelby GT500 sports cars. The robots, constantly learning from the printer data, are helping to improve accuracy and reduce errors in the production of these parts. One of the star performers in this endeavor is a wheeled robot named Javier. Supplied by KUKA, Javier can operate the 3D printer continuously, even after employees have gone home for the day. This round-the-clock operation ensures efficiency and enhances the overall productivity of the production line. Ford's new system allows equipment from different suppliers to communicate in real-time, enabling seamless commands and feedback exchange. Once a 3D printer completes a component, Javier swiftly retrieves it and places it aside for a human operator to collect at a later time. Ford is serious about the potential of this technology and has even filed patents for the communication interfaces and robot positioning that underpin this innovative system. The company has recognized the importance of safeguarding its intellectual property in the rapidly evolving field of advanced manufacturing. While robots are now taking on the task of operating 3D printers, human operators still play a critical role in uploading 3D designs and maintaining the machinery. Their expertise is integral to ensuring the smooth and optimal functioning of the entire manufacturing process. With this technological advancement, Ford is well-positioned to tap into the vast potential of 3D printing and robotics in the automotive industry. The ability to operate 3D printers autonomously will not only enhance productivity but also enable greater customization of car parts, potentially revolutionizing the way vehicles are manufactured. This latest development by Ford demonstrates the company's commitment to embracing cutting-edge technologies and leveraging them for the benefit of its manufacturing processes. By pushing the boundaries of innovation, Ford is solidifying its position as a leader in the automotive industry, paving the way for a more automated and efficient future.
