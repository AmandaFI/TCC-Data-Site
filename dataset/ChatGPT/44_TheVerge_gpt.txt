Mount Pleasant, Wisconsin - Microsoft has been granted permission by the village board of Mount Pleasant to build a data center on land previously allotted to Foxconn's LCD plant, which never materialized. The announcement comes after several years of speculation following the abandonment of the Foxconn project. The sale is set to cost $50 million, and Microsoft may receive $5 million in tax credits per year based on improvements made to the land. The project is expected to start by 2026 and, according to Mount Pleasant officials, will help the village pay down some of the debt it took on to prepare the site for Foxconn. While the number of jobs generated by the data center is expected to be low due to its highly automated nature, local officials hope the economic impact will still benefit the community. "Microsoft has a proven track record of investing in communities and providing well-paying jobs," said Mount Pleasant Village President Dave DeGroot. "We're thrilled to welcome them to our village and look forward to a bright future for all.". While neither Microsoft nor village officials have given any indication of how many jobs the project will create, DeGroot said a company like Microsoft will likely bring high-paying jobs along with supporting the local economy with local purchasing and taxes. Foxconn, on the other hand, has declined to comment on the arrangement but suggested it may be partnering with Microsoft in some capacity. The company's plans have repeatedly changed since it first announced the LCD factory in 2017, including pursuing dairy exporting and fish farming, and building robot coffee kiosks, servers, and ventilators. The debacle has left Mount Pleasant dealing with financial difficulties, including bulldozing dozens of homes to make way for the now-defunct Foxconn project, and taking on massive debt equivalent to 500% of its operating revenue. Mount Pleasant officials hope that the Microsoft data center will stimulate the local economy by paying taxes to the town and pumping funds into local businesses. "We hope this project will help with the post-Foxconn hangover and bring in additional employment," said Jeff Nielsen, director of planning and development for the village of Mount Pleasant. "Our goal is to bring in more tech and high-skilled jobs to the community.". The tech giant currently operates hyperscale data centers in other parts of the US, including Texas, Iowa, and Virginia, and aims to add new data center locations as part of its goal to improve its cloud services. The Foxconn land, located in Mount Pleasant, which was originally designed to be an LCD factory, contains an area of about 2.7 million square feet. While the project will undoubtedly have a positive effect on the local economy, it does raise concerns about the cost of the Foxconn project. Critics have pointed out that the village's decision to bulldoze dozens of homes to clear land for Foxconn was incredibly expensive, costing around $23 million, which, had it been invested in community projects or infrastructure, could have created long-term benefits. Regardless of the past disappointments, Mount Pleasant officials expressed excitement about the new project and remain optimistic about the long-term benefits it could bring to the community. "This is going to be a fantastic addition to our community," said Brent Weycker, president of the Coalition of Greater Racine. "It's a smart move and a huge win for both Mount Pleasant and Microsoft. We're thrilled to have Microsoft as our partner and look forward to them being here for years to come.".
