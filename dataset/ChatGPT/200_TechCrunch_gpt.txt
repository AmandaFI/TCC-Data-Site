Amazon is bringing its innovative cashier-free checkout technology, Just Walk Out, to the world of Major League Baseball. The Houston Astros will be the first team to introduce this system at their home stadium, Minute Maid Park, giving fans the opportunity to purchase food and beverages without the hassle of waiting in long checkout lines. The Just Walk Out technology utilizes artificial intelligence, sensors, and computer vision to create a seamless shopping experience. Customers simply insert their credit cards into the gates when entering the store, pick up the items they desire, and place them back on the shelf if they change their minds. As they leave the store, their credit cards will be automatically charged for the items they have taken. While attendants will still be available to assist customers with their shopping needs, this innovative system eliminates the need for traditional checkout processes. However, customers will still need to show their IDs to an attendant if they wish to purchase alcohol. Dilip Kumar, the VP of Physical Retail & Technology at Amazon, expressed that the Just Walk Out technology aims to provide a fast and efficient shopping experience for customers. By eliminating the need for checkout lines, Amazon hopes to create a more streamlined process that will save customers time and effort. Marcel Braithwaite, the SVP of Business Operations for the Astros, stated that they are proud to collaborate with Amazon to offer a more convenient shopping experience for their fans. By implementing this new technology at Minute Maid Park, the Astros aim to enhance the overall game-day experience for their loyal supporters. The Minute Maid Park stores that will feature the Just Walk Out technology include the 19th Hole store and the Market store. These stores offer a variety of popular snacks, soda, candy, and ready-to-drink alcoholic beverages, ensuring that fans will have plenty of options to choose from. This expansion of Amazon's cashier-less technology comes after its successful implementation in Amazon Go and Fresh locations, as well as its licensing to third-party retailers such as Sainsburyâ€™s. Additionally, Amazon has recently opened Fresh grocery stores equipped with Just Walk Out technology in various locations. As Amazon continues to revolutionize the retail industry with its innovative technologies, the introduction of Just Walk Out at a Major League Baseball stadium demonstrates the company's commitment to providing seamless and convenient shopping experiences for customers in various settings. Fans of the Houston Astros can look forward to a more efficient and enjoyable shopping experience at Minute Maid Park thanks to Amazon's Just Walk Out technology. With no more long checkout lines to contend with, fans can now focus on cheering on their favorite team instead of waiting in line to satisfy their cravings.
