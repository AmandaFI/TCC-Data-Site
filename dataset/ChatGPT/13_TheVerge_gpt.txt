Linus Tech Tips and two other Linus Media Group YouTube channels were recently hacked, with a bad actor taking control and livestreaming crypto scam videos, changing channel names, and even deleting videos. This breach bypassed password and two-factor protections, as the attacker targeted session tokens that kept users logged into the websites. According to Linus Tech Tips owner Linus Sebastian, the breach began when someone on the Linus Media Group's team downloaded what appeared to be a sponsorship offer from a potential partner. Unfortunately, the offer actually contained malware that allowed the attacker to access all user data from both their installed browsers. The hack was discovered after several viewers reported unauthorized streams on Linus Tech Tips' account, prompting the team to investigate and ultimately regain control of their channels. YouTube also investigated the issue and worked with the Linus Tech Tips team to secure and restore their account. Speaking on the attack, Sebastian suggested greater security options for certain channel attributes and some kind of confirmation or verification request if someone tries to mass delete videos. This would help prevent future breaches of a similar nature and protect the channel's content and viewers. The hack underscores the importance of strong cybersecurity measures, even for YouTube channels and other online platforms that may not initially seem vulnerable to attacks. As more and more activities and information move online, individuals and organizations must remain vigilant in protecting themselves and their data. Linus Tech Tips and the Linus Media Group have since resumed their regular programming, thanking their viewers and followers for their patience and support during the incident. They have also urged anyone who may have been affected by the breach to update their passwords and take other necessary security measures to protect themselves.
