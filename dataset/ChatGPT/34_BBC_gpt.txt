Kuwait News, a media outlet based in Kuwait, made waves in the industry by unveiling their virtual news presenter, Fedha, an artificially intelligent creation. Fedha appeared as an image of a woman with blonde hair wearing a black jacket and a white t-shirt. She was introduced to the world via the outlet's Twitter account. Abdullah Boftain, the deputy editor-in-chief for Kuwait News, stated that the move was intended to test AI's potential to offer new and innovative content. They also hope that Fedha will evolve to have a Kuwaiti accent and read online news bulletins in the future. The creation of AI such as Fedha is becoming more prevalent in the industry and is being seen as a way to streamline news services while still providing timely content. The use of AI to create news presenters is a relatively new development, but it is proving to be a fascinating addition to the media industry. . The potential for AI in the media industry has been widely discussed, and a report by Goldman Sachs investment bank last month suggested that AI could replace the equivalent of 300 million full-time jobs. However, the report also suggests that the use of AI will create new jobs and lead to a productivity boom. The emergence of virtual newscasters such as Fedha is just one example of how AI can be used in the media industry. With the potential to create new "talent," AI could revolutionize the way news is delivered across the world. The use of AI in journalism is a growing trend, and even if AI might not completely replace human journalists, it is expected that it will enhance their performance by providing efficient tools to help deliver information to viewers. The leader of Kuwait News, Abdullah Boftain, is pleased with Fedha's success so far and believes that she will gain more popularity soon. For now, the Kuwaiti outlet is a pioneer in using AI-generated news presenters, but this may be the beginning of something much larger. The media industry can expect to see more innovations and breakthroughs in AI in the future, providing for exciting prospects.
