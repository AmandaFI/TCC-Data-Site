Chinese e-commerce platforms Shein and Temu are the latest tech targets in the sights of the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission (USCC), as lawmakers increase scrutiny over trade loopholes, production processes, and sourcing relationships. The companies have been accused of exploiting a US exemption that allows for $800 worth of imported goods to be tariff-free, in addition to concerns over forced labor and intellectual property violations. The heightened scrutiny comes amid growing tensions between the US and China. Chinese start-ups are increasingly taking measures to create more political distance, including relocating their main entity abroad and securing foreign citizenship for executives. However, such moves have not shielded them from increasing US scrutiny. According to the USCC, Shein and Temu's practices could potentially harm US businesses and jobs. Both companies have been accused of sourcing products from factories that use forced labor and violate intellectual property rights. Additionally, the USCC has warned that Shein and Temu are exploiting the US exemption that allows for $800 worth of imported goods to be tariff-free. In response, both companies have issued statements claiming they are committed to supply chain visibility and responsible business practices. Shein has stated that it has implemented new measures to prevent the use of forced labor, such as requiring suppliers to complete a self-assessment questionnaire and conducting factory audits. Temu has also emphasized its commitment to ethical sourcing and claimed to have implemented measures to ensure the quality of its products. Despite these assurances, the USCC has indicated that it will continue to investigate the companies' practices. The concerns raised by the USCC highlight the challenges faced by Chinese start-ups as they seek to expand internationally. The US market is particularly valuable to these companies, as it offers access to a large and wealthy consumer base. However, the increasing scrutiny of Chinese companies by US regulators and lawmakers is making it increasingly difficult for these companies to succeed in the US market. The US-China economic and security relationship is a complex and multifaceted issue that touches on economic, political, and security concerns. The USCC was created in 2000 to provide Congress with an annual report on the state of the economic and security relationship between the US and China. It has become increasingly influential in recent years, as lawmakers and regulators seek to address China's growing economic and military power. The growing scrutiny of Chinese companies by US regulators and lawmakers has been driven in part by concerns over national security. Chinese companies have been accused of stealing US intellectual property, engaging in cyber espionage, and providing a conduit for Chinese state surveillance. These concerns have led to the passage of legislation such as the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act (FIRRMA), which expands the powers of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), and the Export Control Reform Act (ECRA), which restricts the export of emerging technologies to China. The increased scrutiny of Shein and Temu by the USCC signals that Chinese e-commerce platforms are not immune to these concerns. Indeed, the USCC's statement suggests that these companies are being targeted because of their potential impact on US businesses and jobs. This is a reminder that, while Chinese start-ups may have significant economic and technological advantages, they are not immune to the challenges of doing business in a global marketplace that is increasingly affected by geopolitical tensions and national security concerns. Chinese start-ups will need to be mindful of these challenges as they seek to expand internationally. They will need to engage with regulators and lawmakers in a transparent and proactive manner, and implement robust processes to ensure compliance with local laws and regulations. They will also need to develop relationships with local stakeholders, including consumers, business partners, and community organizations. Only by doing so will Chinese start-ups be able to navigate the complex and constantly changing landscape of international business in the 21st century.
