Google is reportedly developing an augmented reality (AR) headset called Project Iris, set to be released in 2024. The device aims to provide an immersive mixed reality experience by blending computer graphics with real-world video feed. Unlike existing AR glasses, the prototypes of Project Iris resemble ski goggles and do not require a tethered connection to an external power source. The hardware is powered by a custom Google processor and runs on Android, with a unique operating system currently in development. To overcome power constraints, Google plans to utilize its data centers to remotely render graphics and transmit them to the headset via an internet connection. Spearheaded by Google executive Clay Bavor and a team of around 300 people, Project Iris is still in the early development stage and lacks a defined go-to-market strategy. Google is considering using the Pixel brand for the headset, with the name "Google Glass" unlikely to be used due to the negative reception of the earlier product. Google has had mixed success in the hardware category, with the ill-fated release of Google Glass in 2012 and a failed attempt to sell VR headsets in 2019. However, competitors Meta (formerly Facebook) and Apple are also working on their own AR and VR products. Google's Project Iris is being kept under wraps at a dedicated facility that requires special access and non-disclosure agreements. In addition to Project Iris, Google is also working on Project Starline, an ultra-high-resolution video chat booth. According to reports, Project Starline is set to be shipped alongside Project Iris in 2024. The company recently hired Paul Greco, the former CTO of Magic Leap, to work on this project. Google intends to deploy Project Starline internally as part of its work strategy and is planning a pilot program for remote meetings using the technology with Fortune 500 companies. Efforts are being made to reduce the cost of each unit for Project Starline. Clay Bavor, who has been leading Google's VR and AR efforts for several years, oversees Project Starline, Project Iris, a new blockchain division, and Google's in-house product incubator called Area 120. Google's interest in AR can be traced back to its investment in Magic Leap and its acquisition of smart glasses startup North. The company has not yet made any comments regarding Project Iris. Google's foray into AR with Project Iris comes after its previous hardware missteps. The release of Google Glass in 2012, touted as a revolutionary piece of technology, failed to gain traction and was largely marked by privacy concerns. Similarly, Google's attempt to market VR headsets in 2019 did not yield the expected results. With Google, Meta, and Apple all working on their AR and VR products, the future looks promising for this technology. While Project Iris is still in the early stages of development, it has the potential to offer users a more immersive mixed reality experience. As Google continues to invest in AR and VR, it will be interesting to see how Project Iris evolves and how it compares to the offerings of its competitors.
