ChatGPT started a new kind of AI race â€” and made text boxes cool again. The world saw a new kind of AI race launched when OpenAI released ChatGPT, a generative AI tool, as a research preview in November. ChatGPT allows users to interact with machines via typing commands in a chat window and has rapidly become the fastest growing consumer app in history. Generative AI has two simultaneous directions, according to an article in The Next Web. It is either adding capabilities to existing tools or creating conversational consumer products. However, it is important to note that despite the allure of messaging interfaces, visual and dedicated User Interfaces (UIs) are still better suited for complex tasks. As AI becomes the product, the text box is making a comeback, and messaging is becoming the interface once again. However, generative AI has the potential to do almost anything, making it challenging to know where to start or how to use it effectively. The rise of conversational AI and messaging interfaces has been a long time coming. Siri and Alexa were just the beginning, and companies like Facebook and Google have invested heavily in conversational AI. However, the recent success of ChatGPT has shown that there is still a lot of potential for a new generation of consumer-facing conversational AI products. ChatGPT's unexpected success seems to stem from its ease of use. It is simple to interact with and provides instant feedback, making it a more engaging experience than many other AI tools. Additionally, the potential for the tool to be used for a wide range of applications is also a big selling point. However, the article argues that there are limits to what generative AI can do. While it is great for certain tasks like customer service, there are some tasks where a visual or dedicated UI is still more practical. For example, if you are designing a complex website or app, a more traditional UI is still the best option. The two directions of generative AI are also reflected in the two main consumer applications of the technology: customer service and chatbots. Chatbots are becoming increasingly popular for customer service, and some of the biggest companies in the world have invested heavily in the technology. However, the capabilities of chatbots are still limited, and they are not yet sophisticated enough to replace human customer service reps entirely. ChatGPT has the potential to change all of that. Its generative nature means that it can be taught to recognize a wide range of customer questions and respond in a way that is similar to how a human would. This could revolutionize the entire customer service industry. If companies could replace their customer service reps with ChatGPT, they would save a significant amount of money on labor costs. Additionally, ChatGPT can provide instant feedback, which is something that human customer service reps cannot do. Despite all of the potential benefits of generative AI, there are still some concerns about the technology. One of the biggest fears is that it will put people out of work. If companies can replace their customer service reps with ChatGPT, what is to stop them from doing the same thing to their other employees? It is a valid concern, and one that needs to be addressed as the technology continues to evolve. Another concern is that generative AI is still in its infancy, and there is a lot that we do not know about how it works. This has led some experts to call for more research into the technology to ensure that it is safe and effective. Overall, ChatGPT has made a big impact in the world of AI and messaging interfaces. Its ease of use and potential to revolutionize customer service has made it one of the fastest-growing consumer apps in history. However, we are still in the early days of generative AI, and there is a lot that we do not yet know about how the technology works or its potential impacts on the workforce. As AI continues to evolve, it will be fascinating to see what new applications are developed and how they change our world.
