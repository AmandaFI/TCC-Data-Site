Goldcast, a Boston-based company, is gaining investor attention as the demand for in-person events increases with the easing of pandemic restrictions. With the global event management software market projected to nearly triple by 2028, Goldcast aims to provide insights on the revenue impact events have on businesses. Other event companies, such as EventX, Twine, Vendelux, and Zuddl, have also taken strategic moves to attract attendees and secure funding as the industry looks towards a post-pandemic resurgence. The market size for event management software grew from $1.5 billion in 2019 to $5.8 billion in 2020, reflecting the shift towards virtual and hybrid event formats. However, the demand for pure online events has decreased as in-person gatherings resume. This has led to layoffs at companies like Hopin, which focused primarily on virtual events during the height of the pandemic. With the return to in-person events, companies like Goldcast are positioning themselves to cater to the needs of marketers in the B2B sector. Goldcast, founded in 2020, offers a comprehensive software stack that allows B2B marketers to host interactive virtual and hybrid events. The platform integrates with analytics tools and workflows to track the impact of these events on the sales pipeline. This differentiation sets Goldcast apart from its competitors and positions it as a valuable resource for companies seeking to understand the return on investment from their event strategies. Recently, Goldcast secured $10 million in seed funding, led by Unusual Ventures. The company plans to utilize this funding to expand its customer base and further develop its product offerings. With 100 customers already onboard, Goldcast has seen significant growth in revenue, increasing between 50% and 150% quarter over quarter in the past year. Sandhya Hegde, a partner at Unusual Ventures, will be joining Goldcast's board as part of the investment agreement. Hegde believes that B2B companies should prioritize go-to-market strategies and implement smart tech stacks to optimize sales. Goldcast aims to provide a scalable engagement channel through virtual events, allowing marketers to effectively manage lead flow and integration. As the event industry continues to evolve, companies like Goldcast are well-positioned to capitalize on the growing demand for event management software. With their focus on B2B marketers and the ability to track the impact of events on sales pipelines, Goldcast offers a unique solution in this rapidly expanding market. With the funds secured from Unusual Ventures, Goldcast will be able to further enhance its technology and expand its reach to a wider customer base. As businesses continue to adapt to the changing landscape of events, Goldcast's software stack and analytics integration provide valuable insights for marketers looking to maximize the impact of their events on their bottom line. Investor interest in event companies like Goldcast reflects the potential for significant growth in the event management software market. As the industry recovers from the disruptions caused by the pandemic, companies that provide valuable insights and tools for marketers will be well-positioned to thrive in this new era of events. Goldcast's focus on B2B marketers and revenue impact sets it apart as a key player in this exciting industry.
