Aston Martin, the iconic British luxury car manufacturer, has announced a new partnership with battery cell technologies company Britishvolt to develop battery cell technology for high-performance cars. The collaboration comes as part of Aston Martin's plans to transition to electric vehicles in the coming years. Aston Martin has committed to releasing its first battery-electric vehicle in 2025, which will serve as a replacement for one of its current sports car models. Additionally, the company aims to offer an electrified powertrain option for all new product lines by 2026 and have a fully electrified core portfolio by 2030. The partnership with Britishvolt will involve a joint research and development team from both companies working on designing, developing, and industrializing battery packs for Aston Martin's electric vehicles. This includes creating bespoke modules and battery management systems that will enhance the performance and efficiency of the cars. While the exact location of the joint R&D facility has not been disclosed, Britishvolt is currently building a Gigaplant site in Northumberland. This facility, expected to be operational by 2027, will have the capacity to produce battery packs for 450,000 electric vehicles annually. The collaboration with Aston Martin is set to further strengthen Britishvolt's position as a leading player in battery cell technology. Britishvolt has recently secured significant funding to support its operations. The company received $2.3 billion in government funding and a $54 million investment from cobalt mining giant Glencore for its Series C funding round. In addition to the partnership with Aston Martin, Britishvolt has also signed agreements with four other carmakers, including Lotus. Aston Martin is also making progress in its electrification journey. The company is set to begin deliveries of its first plug-in hybrid car, the Valhalla, by early 2024. It remains to be seen if the batteries produced by Britishvolt will be utilized in the Valhalla or any other Aston Martin models prior to the release of their fully electric vehicle in 2025. The partnership between Aston Martin and Britishvolt signifies a significant step forward in the development of battery cell technology for high-performance electric vehicles. With their combined expertise and resources, the companies aim to push the boundaries of electric vehicle performance and establish themselves as leaders in the EV market. Car enthusiasts and environmentalists alike will be eagerly awaiting the unveiling of Aston Martin's forthcoming electric models, which promise to deliver both speed and sustainability.
