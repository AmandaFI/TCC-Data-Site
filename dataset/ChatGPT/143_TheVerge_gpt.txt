Meta, formerly known as Facebook, has begun laying off employees in technical roles, as part of its plan to recover from falling revenue growth and losses from its Reality Labs division, known for developing virtual reality and augmented reality products. While the exact number of staff affected by the new round of layoffs is unknown, experts suggest that the figure could be around 4,000. The announcement follows CEO Mark Zuckerberg's statement made on 14 March stating that the company would cut 10,000 more employees, in addition to the 11,000 already let go. The layoffs will occur in three waves. Already recruitment has been affected, and tech groups are scheduled to be impacted in late April, while business groups will be affected in late May. According to Meta, the layoffs are part of the company's "year of efficiency" plan, aimed at streamlining operations and optimizing resources. The company has been struggling with falling revenue growth and losses from its Reality Labs division. While the company's revenue growth has been slowing down, their spending on research and development and other areas has increased. The layoffs come at a difficult time for the firm, as it seeks to expand its reach beyond social media, and compete with other tech giants in emerging fields of technology, such as artificial intelligence, virtual reality, and augmented reality. Although the layoffs may help the company save costs in the short term, they may harm the morale of the remaining employees, and result in a loss in talent in the longer run. . The company has not yet disclosed which offices or departments will be impacted by the layoffs, but the news has sent shockwaves through the tech industry and raised questions about how Meta will restructure to address the pressures facing the company.
