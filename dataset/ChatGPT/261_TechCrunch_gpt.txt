Will quantum computing remain the domain of specialist venture capitalists (VCs)? That is the question on the minds of many as the industry matures and gains investor interest. Market trends indicate that quantum computer manufacturers could generate revenue of $5 billion to $10 billion in the next three to five years, according to the Boston Consulting Group. McKinsey predicts that the chemical and pharmaceutical industries will be the first to utilize quantum computing due to its ability to accurately simulate larger numbers of atoms and molecules. While some venture capitalists are relatively new to quantum technologies, there are those who saw the potential of the industry years ago and are now reaping the benefits. US-based manufacturer IonQ, for example, went public through a Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC) in 2021 with a valuation of $2 billion. Berkeley-based Rigetti is set to follow suit with a SPAC raising $458 million at a $1.5 billion valuation. These initial public offerings set benchmarks for the quantum industry's valuations and demonstrate that venture capitalists can profit from the industry even without extensive commercialization. Currently, quantum processors require specialized lab environments, but there is growing demand for cloud access to these processors. In response, quantum hardware manufacturers are developing their own cloud-based operating systems to facilitate remote access. Unlike the emergence of classical computers, it is unlikely that there will be a dominant quantum operating system company like Microsoft in the 1980s. The article concludes by highlighting the crucial two-year period ahead that will determine the winners in the quantum computing market. Benno Broer, CEO at Qu&Co, suggests that a consolidation phase may occur, leading to the formation of a few leading full-stack quantum hardware players through acquisitions. This potential pathway could shape the future of the quantum industry. Overall, the article explores the maturity and potential of the quantum computing industry, highlighting market projections and the interest of investors. It points out that venture capitalists can already profit from the industry, even without extensive commercialization. The development of cloud-based operating systems for quantum processors is identified as a key trend. Lastly, it suggests that the next two years will be critical in determining the future direction of the quantum computing market, with a possible consolidation phase leading to the emergence of dominant players in the industry.
