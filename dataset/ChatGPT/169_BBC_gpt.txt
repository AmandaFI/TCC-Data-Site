People are devoting a significant portion of their waking time to mobile apps, with an average of 4.8 hours a day spent on their phones, according to a report by app monitoring firm App Annie. The statistics mirror findings from UK regulator Ofcom in 2020, which included watching TV in their research. App Annie's report reveals that apps were downloaded a staggering 230 billion times in 2021, and consumers spent a total of $170 billion on app-related purchases. One standout app was TikTok, which emerged as the most downloaded app globally. Users also spent 90% more time on TikTok compared to the previous year. App Annie predicts that the social media app will exceed 1.5 billion monthly active users by the second half of this year. The study highlights that users dedicated an average of four hours and 48 minutes per day on mobile apps, marking a 30% increase from 2019. This trend was particularly prevalent in Brazil, Indonesia, and South Korea, where users spent over five hours daily on their phones. Notably, seven out of every 10 minutes spent on mobile apps were on social, photo, and video apps, with TikTok leading the way. The mobile gaming industry has also experienced significant growth, with users shelling out $116 billion on mobile games. In the realm of video streaming apps, YouTube claimed the top spot as the most popular, followed closely by Netflix. Despite initial concerns surrounding Apple's privacy crackdown, which allowed users to opt out of data collection by apps, app advertising continues to flourish. Global spending on app advertising reached a staggering $295 billion last year. The COVID-19 pandemic has undoubtedly influenced app usage trends. As people spent more time at home, they increasingly turned to shopping apps, resulting in more than 100 billion hours being dedicated to these platforms worldwide. Similarly, food and drink apps experienced substantial growth as individuals relied on delivery services during lockdowns. Health and fitness apps also saw a surge in popularity, with limited access to gyms and exercise classes leading people to seek alternative ways to stay fit. Well-being apps, such as meditation apps, saw a notable increase in usage, particularly among young people. Furthermore, spending on dating apps skyrocketed, exceeding $4 billion in total. Additionally, countries that developed apps to help manage the COVID-19 crisis experienced high adoption rates. The App Annie report indicates that mobile apps have become an integral part of people's lives, consuming a significant portion of their waking hours. As the world continues to rely more on smartphones and apps for various activities and entertainment, it is expected that these figures will continue to rise in the coming years.
