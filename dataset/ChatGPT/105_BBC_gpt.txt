The tech entrepreneur Bryan Johnson is betting that he can significantly reduce his biological age, the age that his body appears to be, by spending millions of dollars each year. Johnson is part of a growing industry that promises a longevity revolution with techniques that lead to healthier, longer lives by battling cellular decline and reducing inflammation and disease risk in the body. Johnson's efforts represent a larger trend towards prioritizing "healthspans," or the number of healthy years of life, over chronological age. The idea is that if the decline of aging can be delayed, then the risk of age-related illnesses can also be reduced. While lifestyle is responsible for approximately 93% of our longevity, there is still more that can be done to improve our health as we age. As the longevity industry grows, it is offering a variety of products and therapies, from supplements to hot and cold therapies to exercises that are designed to reduce inflammation and disease risk. However, experts caution that it is important to remain skeptical of any claims made by this industry, as progress towards longer, healthier lives will likely come in small-scale increments and will face practical and ethical dilemmas. One potential way to make progress on longevity is to improve our ability to track our body's health as it ages. By flagging health risks in advance and applying new drugs at the right time, we may be able to stay healthier for longer. However, with improvements in health and longevity come new challenges, such as the need to work for longer to support ourselves, and ethical questions around who will have access to the technology and treatments that might emerge. Despite these challenges, Johnson and others in the longevity industry remain optimistic about the potential for progress in this field. While the promise of a dramatic breakthrough is tantalizing, experts believe that progress will instead come in small, incremental changes that will accumulate over time to improve our health and extend our lives.
