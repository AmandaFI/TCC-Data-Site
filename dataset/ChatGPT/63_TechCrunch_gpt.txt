YouTube Premium is introducing new features to attract and retain subscribers, making the service even more enticing for avid viewers. The latest update to the premium service includes both a higher-quality video for web and iOS users and support for co-watching videos on FaceTime through Apple's SharePlay. With the emergence of SharePlay, which allows friends and family members to watch videos together remotely, YouTube Premium has made it easier for users to share their favourite videos with others. This feature makes it possible to co-watch videos on FaceTime, with the ability to pause, play, seek, or skip ahead to the next video, making the experience feel like watching together in-person. In addition to this, YouTube Premium has included new controls for managing video queues on mobile devices. Users can now add and remove videos from their queue and rearrange the order of the videos in the queue, ensuring that they never miss out on a must-watch video. Furthermore, users can continue watching videos where they left off on any device, meaning that if they start watching a video on their phone, they can seamlessly continue watching on their TV or laptop without having to search for the video again. For those who like to watch YouTube content when they're offline, the “smart downloads” feature in this update also automatically saves recommended videos for offline access. This means that users can always have something to watch when they're without an internet connection. One of the most notable updates is the enhanced bitrate version of 1080p HD video quality, first rolling out to iOS users and then to the web. This means that users with compatible devices will be able to watch videos in a much higher quality, making for a more immersive and enjoyable viewing experience. The higher quality videos will be particularly appreciated by those who enjoy watching video content on their mobile devices. These new features aim to better market YouTube Premium to consumers beyond just ad-free viewing. The addition of SharePlay, higher quality video, improved video queue management, and the ability to continue watching videos seamlessly across devices will provide existing subscribers with even more reasons to renew their subscription, while attracting new ones at the same time. YouTube Premium is a subscription-based platform that provides users with an ad-free experience, as well as access to exclusive content and various features. By subscribing to the service, users have access to all the original movies, TV shows, and shorter form content available on YouTube as well as access to YouTube Music Premium. In 2020, over 30 million people worldwide subscribed to YouTube Premium, making it one of the most popular video streaming platforms on the market. While YouTube is best known for its user-generated content, it has gradually become a destination for professional content creators too. By offering exclusive content such as Cobra Kai and Originals, YouTube has signaled its focus on providing a premium experience that’s worth paying for. In summary, YouTube Premium's latest update includes SharePlay support, higher quality video, an ever-more user-friendly video queue management system, and the ability to continue watching videos where users left off on any device. These new features show that the platform is continually evolving, expanding its offering, and providing users with better value than ever before. By doing so, YouTube Premium hopes to appeal to an even wider audience and keep its current subscribers happy, making it one of the most popular streaming platforms available today.
