Multiple Injuries After Ship Tips Over at Edinburgh Dockyard. A research vessel owned by the US Navy has tipped over at an Edinburgh dockyard, injuring 35 people. Emergency services were called to the scene and declared a major incident. The ship, Petrel, was in the process of being loaded with equipment when the incident occurred. NHS Lothian has treated 23 people in the hospital and 12 at the scene, with eight still present at the Royal Infirmary. The injuries range from minor to serious, including broken bones, head injuries, and lacerations. The US Consulate in Edinburgh said it was monitoring the situation and providing support to US citizens involved. The incident occurred at the Leith dock, which has a rich maritime history and is home to the decommissioned Royal Yacht Britannia. The ship has been owned by the US Naval Facilities Engineering and Expeditionary Warfare Center since 2022, and the operation is run by Oceaneering International. It is not yet clear what caused the ship to tip over. Emergency services arrived quickly on the scene, including the Scottish Ambulance Service, HM Coastguard, Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, and the Health and Safety Executive. They worked together to evacuate the injured and secure the area. The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service used specialist equipment to stabilize the ship and prevent further damage to the vessel and the dockyard. The Petrel is a research vessel that the US Navy uses to collect data on oceanography, marine biology, and other scientific research. It was in Edinburgh to be updated with new equipment and to load supplies for an upcoming research mission in the North Sea. The incident has caused outpatient appointments, endoscopies, and planned surgeries to be canceled to free up surgical staff. The Royal Infirmary has implemented its major incident plan to ensure that all patients and staff are cared for efficiently. A spokesperson for the US Navy said that they were aware of the incident and were working closely with local authorities to ensure the safety of their personnel and the public. The spokesperson also stated that an initial investigation had been launched to determine the cause of the incident. The Leith dock has a long-cherished maritime history, and the incident has shocked the local community. Many residents are concerned about the long-term impact that the incident could have on the dockyard and the wider area. The Scottish Government has issued a statement expressing concern about the incident and offering their support to those affected. They have also stated that they will be working closely with the US Embassy to investigate the cause of the incident and ensure that measures are put in place to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future. The incident has also led to calls for stricter regulations in the shipping industry. Many organizations have voiced their concern about the safety standards in the industry and the need for more stringent measures to ensure that incidents like this do not happen again. The investigation into the cause of the incident is ongoing, and more information is expected to be released in the coming days.
