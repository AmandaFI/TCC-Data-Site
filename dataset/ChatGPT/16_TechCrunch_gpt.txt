Is there really a march from the public cloud back on-prem?. As cloud computing continues to become the norm for many businesses, the cost of moving workloads to the cloud can be expensive, and companies are now scrutinizing every entry in the technology budget. As a result, some are looking to move back on-premises, which is a brute force way to reduce cloud expenses but questions why they moved to the cloud in the first place. . Agility in the public cloud is its primary value proposition, where businesses can take advantage of the scalability and flexibility offered by cloud infrastructure. The bad old days of on-premises mean that planning for capacity was a common practice, which could leave a business in a vulnerable position. . The corporate procurement process is time-consuming, and personnel may not have the skills to rack and stack. While it's possible to move certain workloads with less pain than others, it is crucial to recognize that moving back on-premises often means sacrificing agility, scalability, and flexibility. . Ofcom, the UK's communications regulator, recently criticized top cloud infrastructure players for making it too hard to move workloads between clouds. It cited concerns that vendors are using proprietary technologies and APIs to lock customers into their cloud environments. Ofcom's report can be seen as a push towards addressing portability concerns and making it easier for enterprises to avoid vendor lock-in, indicating a trend that may encourage a move back on-premises. According to Synergy Research, the cloud infrastructure market is vast and growing, with a market that reached over $200bn in 2022, up 21% in Q4 2022. Worldwide spending on cloud infrastructure services was up 26% from 2021, while investment in enterprise on-prem infrastructure remains weak. Looking ahead, the research firm predicts strong growth in the cloud market and weak growth in on-premises infrastructure. Many businesses are reluctant to move back on-premises, despite cost savings, because of the agility and flexibility that the cloud offers. Yet, some businesses need a hybrid cloud approach in which certain workloads remain on-premises, while others can be moved to the cloud as needed. In conclusion, moving to the public cloud may be the new norm, but it's vital to scrutinize every entry in the technology budget, especially where costs could spiral out of control. Businesses should consider a hybrid approach that combines the best of both worlds and allows them to take advantage of the scalability and flexibility offered by cloud infrastructure, while keeping certain workloads on-premises. . As the market continues to evolve, public cloud providers need to address portability concerns and make it easier for customers to move workloads between clouds. Whether on-premises or in the cloud, businesses need to be agile and able to respond quickly to changing market conditions, making the right infrastructure choices vital for long-term success.
