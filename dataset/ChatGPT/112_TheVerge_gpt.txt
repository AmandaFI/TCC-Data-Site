The indie game studio, Young Horses, famous for Octodad: Dadliest Catch and Bugsnax has recently released four free games on Steam that are part of the studio's "Free Range initiative". These smaller side projects feature different storyline and themes while offering a unique gaming experience to its players. One of the newly released games included in the initiative is Snakedate, which allows players to navigate through a club as a snake in search of love with horses. The game is essentially a dating simulator, where the player must make the right choices to charm their potential love interests. Apart from Snakedate, the other games featured in the initiative include IndependANT and Antbassador, both insect-themed games that offer different gameplay mechanics. IndependANT follows an ant colony's journey to establish a new colony while Antbassador focuses on the protagonist, Anthony Ant, as he navigates through the human world and tries to communicate with them. Young Horses also included another free game, Octodad: Student Edition, in the initiative, which was initially created by the team when they were still college students. In the game, players take on the role of an octopus impersonating a human and carrying out daily errands while trying to avoid exposing his true identity. The Free Range initiative allows Young Horses to experiment with different game development ideas and bring fun and creative games that the players can enjoy without spending a dime. All the games released under the initiative can be downloaded from the Young Horses Steam page, providing access to a new and exciting gaming experience for its players. The release of these games has garnered a lot of attention, and many users are excited to try out the newly released games. The unique themes and creative storyline of each of the games are expected to keep players engaged and entertained for hours. Overall, the release of these games is proving to be a significant milestone for Young Horses and adding more titles to their already impressive game portfolio, while also giving back to the gaming community in the form of free and fun games.
