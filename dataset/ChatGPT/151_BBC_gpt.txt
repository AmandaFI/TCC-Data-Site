Supermarket customers in the UK may soon have their age estimated by cameras as they attempt to buy alcohol. Major supermarket chains, including Asda, Co-op, and Morrisons, have launched a trial of an automated age-verification system at self-checkouts. The technology, which has already been successfully implemented in Aldi's checkout-free store in London, aims to speed up the purchasing process. The new system uses cameras equipped with algorithms trained on a database of anonymous faces to guess the age of each customer. If the camera determines that a customer is under 25, they will be required to show identification to a member of staff. The company providing the technology, Yoti, emphasizes that this is not facial recognition and assures that the system will not retain any images it captures. Yotiâ€™s algorithm has undergone extensive testing on over 125,000 faces. On average, it was able to accurately guess a person's age within 2.2 years. For individuals aged 16 to 20, the algorithm showed an impressive accuracy rate of 1.5 years. The system's capabilities have garnered excitement among retailers, with Asda's senior director of retail innovation expressing enthusiasm about the potential to make shopping quicker and easier for customers. However, privacy concerns have been raised in the past when similar facial-recognition systems were trialed in Co-op and Sainsbury's stores. Critics argue that the technology could intrude upon individuals' privacy rights by potentially storing or misusing personal data. It is unclear if the current trial addresses these concerns or if customer privacy has been taken into account. This new age-verification system is part of a wider Home Office initiative aimed at exploring technologies that can assist with the sales of alcohol. The goal is to ensure that age restrictions are upheld while making the purchasing experience more efficient for customers. If the trial proves successful, it is likely that other supermarket chains and businesses in the UK will follow suit and adopt similar technologies. While the convenience of automated age-verification systems is lauded, it is crucial that robust safeguards are implemented to protect customer privacy. It remains to be seen how the supermarket chains involved will address these concerns going forward. The trial provides an opportunity for transparency and dialogue between retailers, technology providers, and regulatory bodies to ensure the responsible use of such technologies in the future.
