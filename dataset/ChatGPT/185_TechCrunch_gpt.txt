Seattle-based start-up Bobsled has secured $17m in a Series A funding round to expand its cross-cloud data sharing platform. The funding round was co-led by Madrona Venture Group and Greycroft, following a $7m seed funding round led by .406 Ventures. Bobsled's CEO, Jake Graham, who previously worked for Microsoft Azure, Intel and Neo4j, has created a data-sharing hub that enables businesses to connect their disparate data sources via a more natural approach, using each platform's sharing protocol, while preparing the datasets for future queries. The funds will be used to expand the platform, with a focus on supporting more data sources. Bobsled's goal is to enable companies to simplify their data storage and management by providing a more unified, streamlined experience. With companies increasingly relying on multiple public clouds and platforms for storage and analysis, data sharing and integration have become challenging and complex. Bobsled aims to address this problem by allowing data to freely flow between all of an enterprise's cloud providers. Bobsled's platform relies on APIs and connectors, which enable quick and seamless integration between data sources. Rather than relying on a centralised database, the platform allows businesses to store data wherever they choose, with the data being made available to all the necessary applications and services. Because the platform leverages each cloud's native sharing protocol, businesses can take full advantage of the features of each platform, including performance and reliability enhancements. Bobsled's cross-cloud data sharing platform is built to work with a variety of data sources and systems, including file-sharing protocols, object storage, and databases. The platform enables queries toÂ be run from any source to any destination, offering a level of flexibility and affordability that has never been seen before. With its ability to provide a more seamless and streamlined experience, businesses can use Bobsled's platform to reduce costs, save time and improve productivity. The new funding will enable Bobsled to continue to develop its cross-cloud data sharing platform, with a focus on supporting more data sources. The platform is already being used by businesses in many different industries, including finance, healthcare, retail, marketing, and e-commerce. Bobsled is particularly beneficial for businesses that use multiple public clouds, as data sharing between clouds can be challenging and expensive. Commenting on the funding round, Jake Graham, CEO of Bobsled, stated that the company is excited to use the funds to continue to build its platform, adding that "our focus has always been on providing an easier way for businesses to share their data, and this funding will allow us to expand our platform even further, with a particular focus on support for more data sources.". Meanwhile, Will Byrne, managing director at Madrona Venture Group, stated that "Bobsled's platform helps unlock the full potential of data by enabling real-time access across multiple cloud platforms. We're excited to support Bobsled in continuing to build and scale their platform and become the go-to choice for businesses looking to simplify their data storage and management.". Similarly, Mark Terbeek, partner at Greycroft, said that the company believes "that Bobsled has the potential to transform the way businesses store and manage their data, and we're thrilled to support the company in its continued development and growth.". Overall, the news of Bobsled's funding round is significant in that it highlights the growing demand for cross-cloud data-sharing solutions. With businesses increasingly relying on multiple public clouds and platforms for storage and analysis, the need for a unified, streamlined experience is becoming ever more critical. Bobsled is well-positioned to meet this need, and with this new funding, the company will be able to continue to build and develop its platform to help businesses become more efficient, productive and successful.
