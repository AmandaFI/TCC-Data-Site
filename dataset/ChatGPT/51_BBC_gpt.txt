The Dorset and Somerset Air Ambulance Service is set to receive a new low visibility landing system, which will enable them to land in low cloud conditions. This new system is part of a programme called the Global Navigation Satellite System or GNSS, which is being installed in five selected sites, including the Henstridge Airfield, where the serviceâ€™s headquarters is based. The GNSS programme has been set up to allow helicopter landings in low cloud conditions, which will be especially beneficial to the air ambulance service. The existing helicopter is equipped to use GNSS for approaches, meaning that the new technology will work seamlessly with the existing systems, making it easy to use. Using the GNSS system, the helicopter will be able to land even in situations where the crew cannot see the landing site, so they will no longer have to keep patients waiting in poor weather conditions. This will be a huge relief for both patients and their families, as well as for the service, as it will greatly improve the time taken to reach patients in difficult locations. The air ambulance service is hugely important in the local community, providing vital support to emergency services in medical emergencies. The new low visibility landing system will allow the air ambulance to reach patients who need care, even in adverse weather conditions, which is a great benefit to the entire region. The GNSS programme will become an essential part of air ambulance missions as it will enable the crews to land safely and quickly in more challenging circumstances. The GNSS system is a sophisticated navigation system that not only makes landing easier in low cloud or fog but can also provide an extra layer of safety in other weather conditions. The new low visibility landing system will be a crucial addition to the air ambulance service and is expected to make a significant difference in times of medical emergencies. It is an investment that will undoubtedly pay off in time, helping the service to save even more lives in the future.
