How technology unlocks business models: The story of Netflix. Netflix's announcement to close down its mail-order DVD rental service marked the end of a chapter in the company's history and signalled the remarkable transformation that the American entertainment giant has undergone. From being a scrappy start-up that rented DVDs, the firm today has become a global streaming service with over 200 million subscribers. In an interview with the BBC, Netflix's co-founder and former CEO, Marc Randolph, revealed the journey that the company took in unlocking business models. Netflix was born from Hastings and Randolph's original idea for a video rental-by-mail business, which they envisioned would compete with Blockbuster, the massive Blockbuster chain of video rental stores. In 1997, the idea of online delivery was still largely ignored, and the movie rental business was dominated by brick-and-mortar stores. However, Randolph and Hastings saw a potential for a disruptive technology that could unlock an alternate business model in the video rental industry. The early days saw Netflix explore multiple business models including personalised shampoo, dog food, and online vitamin sales. However, these ideas were soon discovered to not be feasible, and they moved on to CDs and DVDs. Soon after, they tried their hand at video rentals by post and rented out DVDs to their subscribers. The company grew steadily but suffered a setback when Blockbuster entered the market. Blockbuster saw the potential of DVDs by mail and quickly emulated Netflix's business model. However, Netflix was able to weather the storm by innovating upon its delivery process. Instead of continuing their many expensive mail exchanges with DVDs at Blockbuster's locations, they focused on delivering their inventory to consumers' mailboxes, a bold move that turned out to be a game-changer. . However, Netflixâ€™s greatest emphasis on technology came in 2007 when it introduced its streaming service, which allowed customers to instantaneously access a vast library of content via the internet. This disrupted the traditional DVD-by-mail model and marked the beginning of the company's digital transformation. Randolph points out that technology no longer becomes a supporting aspect of the business, but the driver itself. Through technology, Netflix created a new way of delivering content that disrupted traditional business models. By focusing on subscription-based services, simple interfaces, and personalized recommendations, Netflix was able to create a better user experience than traditional television providers. . Throughout the years, Netflix built on its technological prowess, which it leverages to this day. The company's technology sparks the way for improved recommendation algorithms, automated media production, and improved user experience. . As technology evolves, it's important for businesses to keep up and discover unique ways to leverage these developments. For Netflix, technology was a driver for unlocking new business models and creating a unique value proposition around delivering entertainment content. The evolution of Netflix offers a clear example of how technology can enable significant industry disruption and pave the way for revolutionary businesses.
