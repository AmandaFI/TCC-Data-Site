NovoNutrients, a California-based startup, has partnered with Australian energy company Woodside Energy to build a pilot-scale plant that turns carbon dioxide (CO2) into protein. The process involves using bacteria that have metabolic pathways capable of using CO2 as energy. Thus, instead of being released into the atmosphere, the gas is transformed into protein. The NovoNutrients CEO, David Tze, explains that the goal is to "industrialize this naturally occurring metabolism" and deal with the decades-long problem of carbon emissions. The World Bank reports that the world's livestock industry generates over 7 billion tons of CO2, equivalent to 14.5% of all human-made greenhouse gas emissions. NovoNutrients seeks to reduce this number by producing food without relying on traditional agriculture that requires large tracts of land and resources. Instead, their method requires no arable land and provides a sustainable solution to feed the growing population while mitigating environmental damage. Woodside Energy, which operates offshore oil and gas fields in Australia, has committed to investing in clean energy projects such as NovoNutrients. Jan Kalbfleisch, Woodside's Vice President of Ventures and New Business, stated that the company is "looking for opportunities to stimulate transitionary technologies.". The startup will begin large-scale production in 2022. Tze said the pilot plant technology would first target fish feed and pet food, with an eventual goal to produce food for humans. The process could also produce materials for pharmaceutical and industrial markets. NovoNutrients' carbon capture technology is one of several ways that startups and researchers are tackling the carbon crisis. While it is not a silver bullet for the world's environmental challenges, it is a step in the right direction towards a sustainable, low-carbon future.
