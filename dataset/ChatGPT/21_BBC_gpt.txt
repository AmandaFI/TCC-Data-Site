Swedish energy company, Mälarenergi, is leading the way in energy innovation with its plans to convert vast underground caverns beneath the city of Västerås into Europe's largest underground hot water storage system. The system, which will be filled with water heated to 95°C by furnaces used to combust waste and biomass at a nearby power plant, will provide district heating for 98% of households in the city. The system is expected to be operational by 2020. Mälarenergi's decision to create an underground thermal storage system follows a growing trend in Europe as governments look to increase energy security and reduce reliance on finite resources. The use of above-ground systems, which have traditionally been used to store hot water for heating, are often inefficient due to the loss of heat through pipes and insulation. The caverns beneath Västerås were previously used to store oil and are believed to be some of the largest underground storage facilities in Europe. The space, which covers an area of around two million cubic meters, offers Mälarenergi a viable and sustainable solution to the city's heating requirements. Speaking to journalists, Lisa Granström, head of business at Mälarenergi, said: “We will be able to increase the efficiency of the system by 25% to 50% compared to a system that uses above-ground tanks.". As well as increasing the efficiency of the system, the underground storage solution reduces the company's environmental footprint. The use of waste and biomass for heating ensures carbon emissions are kept to a minimum, whilst the underground storage solution reduces the impact on the city's skyline and frees up valuable city space. The project is not without its challenges. The company will have to drill down to the caverns, a process which will demand technical skills and the use of specialist equipment. The team will also have to ensure the caverns are safe for storage purposes and that the heating process is carefully managed to prevent any hazards. However, Granström is confident the team will manage the project effectively. She says: “We are innovative and always looking for better ways to improve the service we offer to our customers.". The project has already received a positive response from local residents who are pleased with the company's commitment to reducing its environmental impact whilst ensuring the continuity of their heating supply. Many have expressed an interest in learning more about the project and how it will affect their homes. The project is also attracting interest from governments and energy providers across Europe. The shift towards renewable and sustainable energy forms is encouraging companies to look for innovative solutions to energy security which do not rely on finite resources. The successful implementation of the Västerås project may lead to similar projects being rolled out in other European cities. The use of underground hot water storage systems is not a new concept. Systems have been in use in various forms for many years. In Switzerland, an underground thermal energy storage system has been operational since 2008. The facility, which is based in an old military bunker, provides energy for around 180,000 people. In Germany, underground thermal storage systems have been in use since the early 1990s, and the country has become a leader in the technology. . In the UK, a similar project was launched in 2017 by the city of Stoke-on-Trent. The city's geothermal project aims to supply up to 2,000 homes and commercial properties with hot water from underground reservoirs. The system will save around 10,000 tonnes of carbon emissions annually, the equivalent of taking 2,000 cars off the road. . The Västerås project, while the largest of its kind in Europe, is far from being the final solution in terms of underground hot water storage. Technical advances will undoubtedly lead to improvements and refinements in the coming years, however it is already clear that the solution offers a sustainable and effective means of storing hot water underground. The success of the Västerås project and similar initiatives like it, may also lead to increased pressure on other companies and cities to implement similar infrastructure. As energy security concerns continue to grow and resources become scarcer, more countries and cities can be expected to look at innovative underground hot water storage to provide the energy security they need.
