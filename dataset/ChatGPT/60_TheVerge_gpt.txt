The Logout Button Has Become Defunct. With the rise of consumer websites and apps, one feature that seems to have lost its importance is the logout button. According to freelance UI designer Jesse Showalter, logging in and access to content have taken priority over logging out, leaving the logout button practically defunct. The reason behind this trend, Showalter explains, is simple: companies have a profit-bearing incentive to keep users logged in. By having people stay logged in for extended periods, companies can increase ad revenue. However, this has resulted in the logout button often being consigned to the depths of the settings menu or removed entirely. And while designers aren't necessarily focused on building a logout feature into interfaces, people are less likely to consider signing out if the option isn't front and center. "People shift constantly between mobile and desktop interfaces, expecting their session data to be seamlessly transferred across devices," Showalter explains. "But if they want to log out, they have to jump through hoops to find that feature.". Additionally, user behavior informs design decisions, and people have become accustomed to staying logged in for convenience. But as users become more aware and concerned about data privacy and the collection of their personal information, they may start to demand more control over their data. "Users are increasingly demanding more transparency and control over what data is collected and used," Showalter says. "And that could change the future of the internet.". One company that has been focusing on giving users more control over their data is Apple. With the release of iOS 14.5, Apple introduced App Tracking Transparency, which requires apps to ask for permission before tracking user data across other apps and websites. In response to this change, Facebook launched a campaign against Apple, claiming that the new feature would hurt small businesses by making it harder for them to target ads to specific users. However, Apple argues that it's simply giving users more control over their data. Showalter believes that other companies will follow in Apple's footsteps and start prioritizing user privacy and control over data collection. "I think it's inevitable that we'll see more companies focusing on transparency and giving users more control over their data," Showalter says. "It's the responsible thing to do.". In the meantime, it's important for users to be aware of the data that is being collected and take steps to protect their privacy. This includes regularly logging out of apps and websites and reviewing privacy settings to limit what data is being shared. While the logout button may have become defunct, it's still an important feature that users should prioritize. By taking control of their data and demanding transparency from companies, users can help shape the future of the internet.
