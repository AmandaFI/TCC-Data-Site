Amazon's palm-reading payment technology, Amazon One, is set to be deployed in Panera Bread restaurants, according to recent reports. The innovative system creates a unique palm print that is linked to a customer's credit card details and Amazon account. While some may have privacy concerns, Amazon One's biometric payment system is seen as a more secure form of authentication than other methods, as identity can't be determined from a palm print alone. Customers at Panera will enjoy a unique experience compared to other fast-food establishments. Employees will be able to communicate with guests about their rewards, order history, and preferences. With the new technology in place, employees can also make personalized recommendations to customers based on their previous orders, habits and interests – this is made possible by combining payment tech, loyalty systems, and unique identifiers. This will help Panera to better target customers with offers and recommendations that match their tastes. Other fast-food restaurants already collected and stored customers' data but, Amazon's palm-reading payment technology, will track customers' preferences and habits more efficiently. Amazon defines the palm-scanning system as a contactless, fast, and easy payment method that eliminates the need for physical payment cards and reduces contact with shared surfaces, making it perfect for the Covid-era. Panera has been doing business with Amazon lately – the restaurant chain announced yesterday that it will let MyPanera members voice-order on Alexa-enabled devices through Amazon. Alexa-integration will allow customers to repeat favourite orders, customize meals and track their most recent orders. . The introduction of Amazon One will make checkout even easier, as palm prints are unique and don't require physical cards or cash, giving customers a quick and efficient way to pay. . "Amazon One has been used at other retailers such as Whole Foods Market stores, Amazon Go, and Amazon Books," Dilip Kumar, vice president of physical retail and technology at Amazon, said in the announcement. "We're thrilled to continue expanding the service and offer the ease and convenience of Amazon One to more customers.". The initial rollout of Amazon One in Panera stores will cover only stores in the northeast United States. Customers will be able to sign up to the service at select locations. Future locations and expansion are already under consideration. . The use of biometric data to make secure transactions is not entirely new, and there have been comments raising concerns on the technology. However, as palm prints are not considered personally identifiable information, the data cannot be used to identify an individual's identity except when combined with other information. Customer information collected will be handled according to Panera's privacy policy, and customers will remain in charge of their data. "The safety and security of our guests and associates will always be a top priority and we were impressed by the slimmer profile of Amazon One and its speedy and secure technology," said Eduardo Luz, chief brand and concept officer at Panera Bread. "Introducing Amazon One at Panera locations in the coming months is only the beginning. We're excited to explore additional opportunities to expand this service.". Amazon One has been criticised in the past for its collection and storage of customers' biometric data. However, the company announced that customers' data would be treated in the same way as other customer data, such as purchasing history and behaviour. Moreover, Amazon would delete biometric data on request. . While the privacy implications of biometric data collection have been the subject of discussion, an argument can be made that it can help protect customers' data better than traditional means of identification. Biometric methods are more difficult to forge and also eliminate the need for passwords and PINs. The deployment of Amazon One in Panera restaurants is expected to simplify the checkout process. Guests will have to register their palm prints, payment information, and Amazon accounts with Panera Bread's loyalty scheme to use the technology. The move signals the continuation of a growing trend where restaurants and other establishments opt for biometric technology, as the technology offers less contact, is less vulnerable to fraud, and provides a more convenient checkout process.
