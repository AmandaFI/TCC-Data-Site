Elon Musk: Tesla to build new battery factory in Shanghai. Tesla has announced plans to build a new factory in Shanghai, China, with the capacity to produce 10,000 of its Megapack energy storage units per year. This newly-announced plant would be Tesla's second Megapack battery factory after the one located in California that currently has the capacity to produce 10,000 battery units per year. Tesla plans to commence building work for its new factory later this year, with the production of energy storage units set to begin in the summer of 2024. The new factory will be situated in Lingang, Shanghai, and is expected to become a key element of Tesla's supply chain strategy. China is the largest battery producer, so this move will provide the automaker access to locally-assembled batteries, which would enable the company to increase production, lower costs, and provide shorter lead times to customers in the region. The Megapack energy storage units are a key component of Tesla's energy business as they can store energy generated from wind farms or solar panels. They are stationary battery systems, larger than the Powerwalls that Tesla has installed in more residential settings. Tesla's Megapack is an emergent market system, primarily designed for utility-scale energy storage around the world. According to the latest reports, Tesla is planning a capacity of 10 GWh of energy storage systems per year, which will significantly contribute to the development of renewable energy infrastructure, paving the way toward a carbon-free future. Tesla already has a subsidiary in Shanghai, which produces its Model 3 sold in China, and the local production gives Tesla better access to the Chinese market as well. Elon Musk's decision to expand the battery business in China comes at a critical time when Beijing and Washington are at odds. However, even though the United States and China are embroiled in a trade war, Tesla has continued to secure its position in the Chinese market, and this move demonstrates the expanding confidence that manufacturers in China have in Tesla products. In a statement, Elon Musk said that the facility would be "designed to be a global center of excellence in battery engineering and manufacturing." As we know from previous reports, the Chinese government has been urging foreign companies to sour partnerships for the production of new energy vehicles as the demand for these kinds of vehicles is on the rise in China. China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology has been promoting the development of new energy vehicles and has shown support for foreign enterprises such as Tesla to maintain an active presence in the Chinese market. The Ministry has also re-affirmed support for the construction of new capacity designed primarily for the production of batteries and other vital electric vehicle components. Furthermore, the Shanghai municipal government has also expressed its full support of Tesla, and the new factory is anticipated to create thousands of jobs. By securing local battery supply chains, the expansion of Tesla's production capacity in China has the potential to cut costs and shorten delivery times for customers. . The future looks bright for Tesla as it expands its operations in Shanghai, and provides new opportunities for the company to demonstrate its commitment to the Chinese market and the world at large.
