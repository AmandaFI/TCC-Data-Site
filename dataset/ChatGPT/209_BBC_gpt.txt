Russia-Ukraine: Is internet on verge of break-up? The conflict in Ukraine has not only disrupted nations and their citizens but also the landscape of the internet. Corporate giants, including Meta, Google, and Apple, have responded to Russia's invasion by banning their products in the country, leading to a significant change in the online environment. Twitter, Facebook, and TikTok have also implemented restrictions for Russian users. As a result, concerns are growing that the conflict could fundamentally alter the nature of the global internet. In response to the invasion, the Ukrainian government has called for Russia to be completely cut off from the global internet. It has singled out individual tech firms, urging them to ban their services in Russia. However, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), which governs internet policies, rejected this request. ICANN emphasized its neutrality and stated that it does not take punitive actions. The Digital privacy group Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) supported ICANN's decision and warned about the dangerous consequences of interfering with fundamental internet infrastructure protocols. The concept of a "Splinternet" has been brought up in these discussions. It refers to a scenario where different countries have their own versions of the internet, potentially leading to a fragmented online world. China's Great Firewall, which restricts access to certain foreign websites, serves as a prominent example. Iran also exercises state control over internet content, resulting in limited access for its citizens. Russia has been experimenting with its own version of the internet, called Runet, which configures the internet within its borders as a private network. Although Russia denies any immediate plans to disconnect, the recent test on Russian internet service providers was seen by experts as a preparation for such a move. Experts argue that the ongoing conflict in Ukraine is reshaping the internet environment, potentially leading to nations being cut off or developing alternative versions of the internet. This division of net power could result in a split between the West and China/Russia. Russia might seek support from China to create a firewall similar to China's Great Firewall, relying on their assistance in reshaping their internet regulations. The role of tech companies like Huawei, who have remained silent on the conflict, could be significant in this new internet landscape. The implications of a fractured internet are far-reaching. It could limit access to information and restrict communication between nations on an unprecedented scale. It also raises concerns about digital rights, privacy, and freedom of speech. Some fear that a divided internet could give authoritarian regimes greater control over the flow of information and create a less open and interconnected online world. While ICANN's rejection of Ukraine's request to ban services in Russia reflects a commitment to internet neutrality, the conflict highlights the potential vulnerabilities of interconnected global networks. With various nations considering or already implementing restrictions, the question of whether the internet is on the verge of a breakup becomes increasingly pressing. As the conflict continues to unfold, the fate of the global internet hangs in the balance. The decisions made by tech companies, governing bodies like ICANN, and the actions taken by nations will shape the future of the online world. It remains to be seen whether a compromise can be reached that maintains the principles of an open and connected internet, while addressing legitimate national security concerns. The conflict in Ukraine has thrust the internet into a new era of geopolitical challenges, where the boundaries between physical and digital warfare are becoming increasingly blurred.
