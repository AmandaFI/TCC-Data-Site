Amazon's company culture may be hurting its streaming business, according to a report by The Hollywood Reporter. The report states that Amazon's Prime Video streaming service is facing obstacles due to the "Big Tech" culture of Amazon. The company's compensation structure, "agile seating" policy, and lack of Hollywood-style risk-taking have caused concern among some industry experts. The report points to Prime Video head Jennifer Salke as a specific cause for concern. According to the report's sources, Salke has not been successful in achieving growth for the service. However, others argue that the issue is not with Salke but with Amazon's overall culture. One of the major areas of concern is Amazon's compensation structure, which caps base pay at $350,000 with stock options. This approach is at odds with Hollywood's practices, which often include large salaries and bonuses. Some experts argue that this structure has led to a lack of incentive for Amazon employees to truly excel in their roles. Another issue is Amazon's "agile seating" policy, which only provides offices for top executives. This approach has been criticized as not conducive to creativity and collaboration. In contrast, Hollywood studios often provide private offices for key personnel and encourage a more open and collaborative work environment. Overall, the report argues that Amazon's company culture is more suited to the tech industry than entertainment. Tech-based streamers like Amazon let metrics drive their decisions, whereas Hollywood-based streamers are more willing to take risks. This difference in approach may be why Amazon has struggled to achieve significant growth in its streaming business. Despite spending $7bn last year on video production and music, Amazon has not seen a significant increase in subscriber numbers. This is in contrast to competitors like Netflix and Disney+, which have seen a rapid rise in subscribers in recent years. Industry experts have called on Amazon to consider re-evaluating its approach to streaming and entertainment. This could include changes to its compensation structure, office policies, and overall culture. Without these changes, Amazon may continue to struggle in the highly competitive streaming market. In response to the report, Amazon has stated that it is committed to growing its streaming business and that it will continue to invest in original content. The company also stated that it values its employees and is open to feedback on its policies and practices. The report has sparked a broader conversation about the intersection of tech and entertainment. As more tech companies enter the entertainment industry, there will likely be a growing need for companies to balance their tech culture with the unique demands of the entertainment industry. Overall, the report highlights the importance of culture in the success of any business. For Amazon's streaming business, a shift towards a more Hollywood-style approach could be necessary for future growth. However, the company will need to carefully balance this with its existing culture and values. Ultimately, the success of Amazon's streaming business may hinge on its ability to find this balance and adapt to the changing demands of the industry.
