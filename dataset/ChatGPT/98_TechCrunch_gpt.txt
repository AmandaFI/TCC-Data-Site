Instagram has unveiled two new tools aimed at driving revenue for advertisers: the introduction of ads in search results and the launch of Reminder Ads. As the parent company of Instagram, Meta is hoping that these new tools will give businesses the opportunity to increase their visibility while boosting their engagement with customers. The first tool, testing ads in search results, aims to give advertisers the chance to show up in the feed that people can scroll when they tap into a post from search results. Meta has already been testing this feature and plans to launch ads in search results worldwide in the coming months. The second tool, Reminder Ads, is designed to enable businesses to notify users of upcoming events, launches and promotions. This new feature is aimed at making it easier for brands to announce and remind people about their products and services, thereby boosting engagement with customers across the Instagram platform. The introduction of these new tools comes at a time when Meta is looking to increase revenue in the face of a decline in ad sales in Q4 2022. With more businesses turning to digital advertising, Instagram is hoping that these new features will be just what brands need to drive conversions and boost their engagement rates. The move is part of a broader trend within the social media industry, as social media companies look to boost their advertising revenue streams and attract new advertisers to their platforms.
