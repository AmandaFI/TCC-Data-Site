Social media giant Snap quietly acquired Dutch 3D-scanning studio Th3rd in Q2 2021, according to sources familiar with the matter. The acquisition was made to support Snap's augmented reality (AR)-powered commerce strategy, which the company has been pushing heavily in recent months. Th3rd's technology allows brands and retailers to digitise their product catalogue at scale, making it an attractive acquisition for Snap, which has been investing heavily in AR technology. Four team members from Th3rd have joined Snap, although the financial terms of the deal have not been disclosed. Snap said that Th3rd's technology has been used to enhance its AR projects, including its Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) product for brands. The product offers features such as AR try-on and sizing recommendation technology to improve the shopping experience for Snapchat users. . Since January 2021, 250 million Snapchat users have interacted with AR shopping lenses more than 5 billion times, according to Snap. The company believes that the AR retail market will be worth an estimated $1.2tn by 2030. Snap's acquisition of Th3rd is part of a wider push into retail and e-commerce. The company has been experimenting with AR-powered shopping experiences for the past few years, as it tries to find new ways to monetise its platform. . Snap has also been making moves into the payments space, with the launch of its Snapcash feature in 2014. While the feature was eventually discontinued in 2018, the company has continued to explore opportunities in this area. . Although Snap's revenue increased by 116% year on year in Q2 2021, the company's share price has struggled in recent weeks. The company's stock fell by nearly 25% in late July following its Q2 earnings report, which showed slower-than-expected user growth. However, Snap's strong revenue growth has given the company reason to be optimistic about the future. . Snap is not the only company exploring the potential of AR technology in retail. Other major players in the industry, including Facebook and Google, have also been investing heavily in this area. . In recent years, a number of startups have also emerged that are focused on using AR technology to improve the shopping experience. These companies are offering solutions such as AR try-on and product visualisation, allowing customers to "see" the products they are interested in, before making a purchase. . As the demand for online shopping continues to grow, and as consumers become more comfortable with buying products online, AR technology is likely to play an increasingly important role in the retail industry. By acquiring Th3rd, Snap has positioned itself to be at the forefront of this trend. The acquisition of Th3rd may also help Snap to differentiate itself from its competitors in the social media space. While Snapchat's user base is smaller than that of Facebook and Instagram, the company has been successful in attracting younger users, and its unique features, such as AR lenses, have helped to set it apart. . Snap has not yet announced any plans to integrate Th3rd's technology into its platform, but the acquisition is a clear indication that the company is committed to investing in AR technology and using it to drive revenue growth in the coming years. . Snap's move into the e-commerce space is likely to be closely watched by investors and analysts, as the company looks for new ways to monetise its platform and drive growth. With the retail industry rapidly evolving, it remains to be seen whether Snap's bet on AR-powered commerce will pay off in the long run. However, the company's strong financial performance in Q2 2021 suggests that it is moving in the right direction.
