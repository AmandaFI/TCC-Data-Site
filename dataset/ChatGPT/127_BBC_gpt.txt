Facebook owner Meta sees latest layoffs begin. The owner of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, Meta, has begun notifying staff who will be losing their jobs in the company's wave of 10,000 job cuts. The layoffs were announced last month and are necessary for making the company more efficient. Meta has faced pressure since a sharp slowdown in its ads business last year and had already let go of 13% of its staff in 2021. The company is now trimming its workforce in various departments, including IT, business, and administration. Reports suggest that London-based Instagram employees will either be cut or relocated. Experts believe that the recent developments in Meta's workforce are reflective of a wider economic slowdown that has seen more than 170,000 people in the tech industry being laid off globally since the start of the year. The pandemic has caused lower advertising demand and a shift in consumer behaviour, which has impacted Meta's business. Despite this, Meta has expressed optimism about the future. The company's CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, issued a statement in November, saying that the job cuts would allow Meta to focus on its core objectives, including the metaverse, a new virtual reality platform that the company hopes will be the future of social media. The metaverse, which allows users to interact virtually with each other in a simulated environment, has been called the next big thing in tech. Meta has already invested billions of dollars in developing the technology and has announced plans to hire thousands of workers for the project. But some analysts believe that the metaverse may not be the solution to Meta's troubles. Many worry that the company is putting all of its eggs in one basket and that the project is still years away from becoming profitable. For now, the company must navigate the layoffs and the changing landscape of the tech industry. Although Meta has faced setbacks in recent years, it remains one of the most powerful tech companies in the world. With its vast user base and resources, it is likely that Meta will continue to play a major role in shaping the future of technology and social media.
