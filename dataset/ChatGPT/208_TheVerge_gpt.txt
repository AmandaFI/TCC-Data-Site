GoPro, the popular action camera company, has announced its plans to expand its camera lineup in the coming year. During its recent earnings presentation, the company's founder and CEO, Nick Woodman, revealed that two new camera models will be introduced alongside its existing Hero and Max cameras. The goal of this expansion is to provide more specialized cameras to cater to different groups of users, while still utilizing GoPro's existing technology. In the past, GoPro had multiple models in its Hero lineup, but since the release of the Hero 8, the company has shifted its focus to flagship models and sold older models instead of introducing lower-spec but still current-gen cameras. Woodman emphasized that the intention behind introducing more models is not to return to the previous "good/better/best" model, but rather to offer options that appeal to different user segments. Moreover, GoPro aims to target the professional market by creating "premium solutions" that are tailored to specific use-cases, rather than offering a one-size-fits-all product. The two new models that will be added to GoPro's lineup will still draw upon the company's existing technology, but they will be built for different purposes. Woodman referred to these new additions as "derivatives." This approach allows GoPro to create new cameras at a lower cost while leveraging the custom chips that power its current cameras. In addition to expanding its camera lineup, GoPro also shared its roadmap for the future. The company plans to introduce new cloud capabilities and a subscription-based desktop application. These new features aim to enhance the overall user experience and provide additional value to GoPro customers. GoPro's expansion plans come at a time when the demand for action cameras is surging. With more people participating in adventure sports and seeking unique ways to capture their experiences, GoPro aims to stay at the forefront of the market by offering a range of high-quality cameras that cater to various needs. Investors and customers alike are eagerly waiting for the new camera models to be unveiled and the added cloud capabilities and desktop application to be rolled out. With GoPro's commitment to innovation and catering to different user segments, the company is poised to maintain its strong position in the action camera market.
