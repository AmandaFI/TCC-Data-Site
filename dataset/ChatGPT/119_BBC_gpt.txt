The Acro Criminal Records Office, which controls criminal records in the UK, is still struggling to recover from a crippling cyber attack which struck almost a month ago. The service, which offers access to records to the police and other agencies in the UK, as well as processing certificates of good conduct for emigration visas and employment in roles which require oversight around children, was the victim of a major attack on 21 March. To avoid risking further security compromise, Acro immediately took their website and application portal offline upon identifying the attack, sealing off access until the service can be completely safeguarded. The office has experienced significant disruption since the attack and has sought to bolster its workforce to manage a surge in email applications, though delays in the processes it manages have persisted ever since the attack. At the time the breach was initially discovered, the UK’s National Crime Agency explained that no personal data was known to have been exposed or taken. Despite this positive news, investigations by the police and other authorities are ongoing to assess the scale of the attack and any potential follow-on effects. Currently, there is no conclusive evidence to suggest that personal data was compromised. As part of its responsibilities, Acro manages the UK’s visa applications. This function of the organisation’s operations has faced some trouble during this period of IT disruption. It was confirmed that efforts to resolve the issues have focused mostly on criminal record disclosures, with delays stretching to up to three weeks. Acro Criminal Records Office is the central point for the exchange of criminal records information between the UK and other countries. A cyber breach impacting its operations raises the possibility of UK citizens’ data being misused overseas or even damage being done by criminals travelling freely to the UK. Despite this, there is no evidence that criminals or criminal organisations have been involved in this particular cyber incident. Cyber attack on the rise. The incident on Acro’s systems is just one example of the wave of cyberattacks that have hit the UK in recent years. In 2017, the WannaCry ransomware attack brought the NHS to its knees affecting computers across 150 different countries around the world. The chaos that ensued was so far-reaching that Telecommunications giant BT issued guidance to all of its customers in the period that followed urging them to update their anti-virus software and take steps to protect themselves. As the world becomes increasingly interconnected, the opportunities for hackers to target sensitive systems and gain access to personal data continue to grow. Governments and businesses alike are consistently targeted and risks need to be addressed at every stage of the IT supply chain. The current issues surrounding the Acro Criminal Record Office highlight the sensitivity of information related to criminal activity, particularly in a time where cyber breaches and the compromise of personal data are threatening to become an everyday occurrence. It remains to be seen whether or not the organisation can resume its full complement of services quickly, or whether the repercussions of the attack are more lasting. With ongoing investigations in progress, the public will need to wait until conclusive evidence is presented about whether the data on its servers was actually compromised.
