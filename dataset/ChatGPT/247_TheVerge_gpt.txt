Biden demands Congress protect kids online in State of the Union address. President Joe Biden delivered his first State of the Union address on Tuesday, highlighting the urgent need to enhance child safety on social media platforms. In a historic move, Biden called on Congress to pass new regulations to protect children on platforms such as Facebook and Instagram. The White House plans to make specific funding requests to study and improve children's online safety. During his address, Biden specifically requested Congress to establish stronger children's privacy rules and to ban targeted advertising to children. He also emphasized the importance of pressuring social media companies to prioritize child safety in the design of their products. The president aims to hold social media platforms accountable for the impact they have on the safety of young users. The call for stronger regulations followed the recent testimonies of Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen, who accused Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, of neglecting the safety of young users. Haugen was invited as a special guest of First Lady Jill Biden for the State of the Union address. The testimonies shed light on the need to strengthen privacy protections, ban targeted advertising to children, and stop tech companies from collecting personal data on children. Both Republicans and Democrats expressed agreement on the need for stronger children's privacy rules after Haugen's testimony, although the specific regulations are yet to be determined. Senators Richard Blumenthal and Ed Markey had previously proposed the KIDS Act, which aims to impose limits on app developers designing applications for children and ban targeted advertising to children. This aligns with Biden's request during his State of the Union address. In addition to the call for regulations, Biden announced that he would allocate $5 million in his 2023 budget for research on the impact of social media on mental health and potential interventions that the administration can undertake. Recognizing the need for a comprehensive approach, the Department of Health and Human Services will launch a "national Center of Excellence on Social Media and Mental Illness" to develop and distribute guidance on the impact of adolescent social media use. The White House also plans to address the issue of social media algorithms disproportionately targeting children, particularly those from minority backgrounds. By targeting these algorithms, the administration aims to create a safer online environment for all young users. President Biden's State of the Union address marks a significant step toward improving child safety on social media platforms. With bipartisan support and specific plans for stronger regulations, the White House is determined to protect children from the potential harms of online platforms. As the discussion continues, it remains to be seen how Congress will respond and what specific measures will be taken to enhance child safety in the digital age.
