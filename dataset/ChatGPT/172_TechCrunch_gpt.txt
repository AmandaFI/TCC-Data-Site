Vesey Ventures, a fintech-focused venture firm founded by former managing directors of Amex Ventures, has closed its debut fund at $78m. The aim of the company is to issue bespoke “Strategy Sheets” for the companies it backs, outlining how Vesey Ventures aims to leverage its network to become the start-up’s first business development team. The firm has already backed five emerging businesses, with checks from $1.5m to $3m. Vesey Ventures aims to invest both inside and outside traditional financial sectors, in areas such as embedded fintech, vertical software, the future of commerce and the infrastructure layer. The three managing directors from Amex Ventures, Zohar Steinberg, Tal Schwartz, and David Sica, founded Vesey Ventures to help start-ups partner, expand and commercialise in the US market. The founders expressed their view that the company’s background in financial services and payments coupled with its network will give it the ability to add value to companies beyond just the funding. Vesey Ventures defines fintech in the broadest sense, reserving the right to invest outside traditional financial services across many different markets. . Upon closing the fund, Vesey Ventures has already invested in five companies across the fintech industry. The specifics of these companies have not been disclosed. However, Vesey Ventures is able to invest in a range of technologies and businesses with the potential to work alongside financial incumbents. The powerful funding addressable by Vesey Ventures will provide these early-stage companies with a significant boost in their quest to solve the most pressing challenges across industries. . The new venture intends to invest in areas where it can leverage its network, experiences, and domain knowledge to become one of its portfolio company’s business development teams and grow its customer base. Beyond term sheets, Vesey Ventures issues “Strategy Sheets” outlining their action plan for each portfolio company and how they plan to expand with the guidance of their seasoned team. The firm’s emphasis on building partnerships early in the process is expected to fast-track the growth of its portfolio and increase its chances of success. As part of its investment approach, Vesey Ventures will focus on businesses which have a potential impact on the traditional financial services industry. This includes the likes of blockchain technology, artificial intelligence, automation, cloud computing and infrastructure. The founders of Vesey Ventures know this space well, having worked closely with Amex to build Amex Ventures. They bring a wealth of industry knowledge and expertise to the table, which they plan to use to help emerging tech companies succeed. . The company has also chosen an unexpected location for its headquarters, setting up shop in Israel, which is home to one of the fastest growing tech hubs in the world. This move is expected to allow Vesey Ventures to leverage Israel’s vast spectrum of technology skills and foster relationships with key stakeholders in the country’s thriving tech ecosystem. With strong ties to Silicon Valley, the firm will have an advantage in terms of accessing both US and Israeli capital markets, which are among the largest in the world. Overall, Vesey Ventures has emerged with a significant backing of $78m for its debut fund. The vision of this new venture is to be an important partner to many early-stage businesses, providing not only funding but also working with them to develop their strategies and networks, provide critical business development guidance and support. The team’s deep knowledge of emerging markets and trends positions Vesey Ventures as a unique venture firm to watch in the fintech space. With broader definitions of what constitutes fintech technology, Vesey Ventures has set itself up to be a powerful ally to fintechs across a variety of industries, and their vision of being a first business development team sets them apart in the competitive world of early stage investing.
