Elon Musk: Twitter says parts of source code leaked online. Twitter has requested the removal of parts of the source code for Elon Musk's social media platform, which were leaked on the software development platform, GitHub. The leaked information has revealed that the firm is valued at less than half of the $44bn price tag Musk paid for it in 2019. The code leak coincided with Musk's recent decision to cut the workforce by a third. The departure of several advertisers from the platform had also raised concerns among the company's executives about the firm's financial prospects. Twitter has requested that GitHub reveal information about the "FreeSpeechEnthusiast" account that posted the code, citing copyright infringement. The leak appears to have originated from an account with links to a group that promotes free speech. The leaked information has also revealed that Twitter has been struggling with a number of technical issues, which may have contributed to the company's problems. Despite its vast infrastructure, Twitter has struggled to maintain the reliability of its platform. The leak comes at a time when many technology companies are struggling to adapt to the rapidly changing landscape of the internet. Many are facing new regulatory challenges and increased competition from smaller, more agile companies. Twitter's struggles have also been compounded by a growing number of high-profile users who have abandoned the platform, citing concerns over censorship and privacy. Despite these challenges, Twitter remains one of the most popular social media platforms in the world. It is used by millions of people every day to connect with friends, share news and engage in political discussions. However, with the leak of its source code and growing concerns over its financial prospects, the future of the platform remains uncertain. Many are hoping that Elon Musk, one of the world's most influential entrepreneurs, can use his vast resources and technical expertise to help steer the company back on track.
