Honda has announced its plans to release a new, mid to large-sized electric SUV for the US market in 2025. The vehicle, which will be built on top of the Honda e Architecture EV platform, is expected to debut with an innovative platform called Electric and Electronic architecture, or E&E architecture for short. The E&E architecture uses advanced OTA software-upgradable technology, allowing electric SUV owners to stay up-to-date with the latest software features. Honda has partnered with LG Energy Solution and SES to develop its own solid-state battery technology, which is set to be introduced in new EVs in the second half of the 2020s. Solid-state battery technology promises significant benefits over traditional lithium-ion batteries, including longer range, faster charging times and increased safety. The new electric SUV is part of Honda's broader plan to build 2 million EVs annually by 2030, and only build electric and fuel-cell vehicles globally by 2040. This bold plan is a reflection of Honda's commitment to reducing its carbon footprint and contributing to a more sustainable future. Honda is well known for its fuel-efficient cars, with models like the Insight and Fit leading the way in terms of eco-friendliness. However, the automaker has traditionally lagged behind its competitors when it comes to EVs. With the unveiling of the new electric SUV, Honda is hoping to change that perception and take a larger share of the EV market. The Honda e Architecture EV platform, on which the new electric SUV will be built, is already in use in the Honda e, a small electric hatchback that has received rave reviews from critics. The platform is designed to be flexible, with the capability to accommodate a range of different vehicle types and sizes. The new electric SUV is set to fill a gap in Honda's current lineup, with no mid to large-sized electric SUVs currently available in the US market. This puts Honda at a disadvantage compared to competitors like Tesla and Ford, who already have popular electric SUVs such as the Model X and Mustang Mach-E. The E&E architecture, which is set to debut with the new electric SUV, promises to be a game-changer for electric vehicles. The OTA software-upgradability will allow owners to stay up-to-date with the latest features and technology without needing to visit a dealership. This is particularly important in a rapidly-evolving market, where new features and advancements are being developed all the time. Overall, Honda's commitment to reducing its carbon footprint and investing in the development of new electric technologies is a positive sign for the electric vehicle market. With the unveiling of the new electric SUV, Honda is set to take a bigger share of the EV market and challenge its competitors. As the automotive industry continues to shift towards electric and sustainable technologies, Honda is well-positioned to thrive and contribute to a more sustainable future for all.
