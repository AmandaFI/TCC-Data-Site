Microsoft has released its latest DirectStorage SDK that will boost loading times for games on older hard drives. The DirectStorage 1.2 features an added capability that helps speed up legacy hard disk drives by introducing a buffered mode. This feature eliminates the need for separate methods for multiple types of drives. Initially, Microsoft developed DirectStorage technology to stream data from fast NVMe solid-state drives to GPUs but has now included support for HDDs. In DirectStorage 1.2, Microsoft has incorporated improvements that will increase the speed of GPU decompression of textures. Although only Forspoken has added DirectStorage support, graphics card makers such as Nvidia, AMD, and Intel have pledged their support for the latest GPU decompression techniques of DirectStorage, and game developers are expected to follow suit. DirectStorage, by Microsoft, has already taken up a considerable portion of the tech market, and its latest version has been long-awaited by the gaming industry. The technology comes in handy when developers need to search large amounts of data without having to exit the game. Instead of relying on traditional buffering methods, DirectStorage 1.2 can help to get data rapidly to the target device using I/O and memory methods. According to the company's representative, adding support for HDDs is crucial because not everyone can afford high-speed solid-state drives. "With the introduction of DirectStorage for HDDs, game developers can design games that take advantage of the next-generation storage technology while still being compatible with traditional hard drives," said the representative. Gamers can expect to see significant improvements in gaming performance with the DirectStorage 1.2 release. The technology will benefit gamers who still use traditional hard drives or SSDs, allowing them to experience swift load times and immersive gameplay. In conclusion, the release of Microsoft's DirectStorage 1.2 is set to revolutionize gaming performance and speed by implementing advanced techniques that cater to all kinds of storage media. The new DirectStorage SDK is expected to make a breakthrough in the gaming industry, while hardware owners will benefit from the latest innovations that improve GPU decompression and load times while they play their favorite games, making for a smoother and more enjoyable overall gaming experience.
