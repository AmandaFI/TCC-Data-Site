Cannabis dispensaries throughout the United States are encountering difficulties receiving payments due to federal laws that prohibit the processing of credit card transactions for the sale of a Schedule 1 controlled substance, such as cannabis. Major financial institutions have refused to process payments for dispensaries because doing so could be considered bank fraud. This has left dispensaries scrambling for alternative payment solutions, such as cash-only transactions or cryptocurrency. Smoakland, an Oakland-based dispensary, recently attempted to sell cannabis via credit card by using a legal loophole. But the dispensary's process partner terminated the relationship, citing potential bank fraud. This has forced Smoakland to look for an alternative payment solution. Posabit, another dispensary in Seattle, previously allowed users to purchase cryptocurrency via a credit card to use for legal cannabis purchases. However, the dispensary has since removed the option due to the illegality of the practice. Despite the difficulties, Smoakland has stated that it will continue to pursue a credit card payment solution. The dispensary has announced it plans to move forward with a bank-sponsored merchant services solution. However, the U.S. government remains steadfast in its position against circumventing federal legislation around payment processing for cannabis sales. Industry insiders have noted that the legal cannabis industry faces unique challenges related to banking and payments. Dispensaries are often forced to accept cash-only payments, which can make them vulnerable to theft and robbery. The inability to access traditional banking services also limits dispensaries' ability to obtain loans and other financial services. The lack of access to credit card processing has also been a hindrance to the growth of the legal cannabis industry. Analysts estimate that total legal cannabis sales in the United States could exceed $30 billion by 2025. However, without access to traditional banking and payment processing services, the industry's growth may be hampered. To address these challenges, lawmakers have introduced several bills aimed at increasing access to banking services for the cannabis industry. The Secure and Fair Enforcement (SAFE) Banking Act, which passed the House of Representatives in April 2021, would allow banks to offer services to cannabis businesses in states where it is legal. However, the bill has yet to be taken up by the Senate. In the absence of federal action, some cannabis companies have turned to alternative payment solutions, such as cryptocurrency. However, this practice remains illegal, and companies that attempt to use cryptocurrency for cannabis transactions may face legal action from federal regulators. Despite these challenges, the legal cannabis industry continues to grow. Analysts project that the industry will continue to expand as more states legalize cannabis for medical or recreational use. However, until federal legislation changes to allow for traditional banking and payment processing services, cannabis businesses will continue to struggle to access essential financial services. As the industry continues to grow, the need for a safe and reliable payment processing solution becomes increasingly urgent.
