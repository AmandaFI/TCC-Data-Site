Equator, a climate tech venture capital firm focusing on sub-Saharan Africa, has announced that it has successfully raised $40m for its first fund. The firm plans to use the funds to back seed and Series A stage startups across the energy, agriculture and mobility sectors in sub-Saharan Africa. Equator hopes to act as a bridge between startups' earliest checks and growth capital from large regional climate tech funds and corporations. This will help create a sustainable ecosystem for climate tech in sub-Saharan Africa, where access to funding is limited. The venture capital firm will invest with round sizes of $10m or less, which is typical for pre-Series B clean tech startups in sub-Saharan Africa. Equator will expect to leverage the current shift in the global narrative about climate tech's importance and impact on climate change to attract more investors to the fund. Speaking on the development, Bobby Patton Jr., co-founder at Equator, said, "We are excited to announce the successful close of our first fund. This milestone is a testament to the strong and growing interest in climate tech investment across sub-Saharan Africa.". The fund has received commitments from several renowned investors, including the Green Climate Fund, the International Finance Corporation, and the African Development Bank. Equator was co-founded by Bobby Patton Jr., a private equity specialist, and Taylor Rosenthal, a climate change and international development expert. Both have extensive experience working in Africa, and they believe that the continent has significant untapped potential for climate tech innovations. The firm's focus on sub-Saharan Africa is particularly noteworthy, as the region is highly vulnerable to the impact of climate change. Climate experts warn that sub-Saharan Africa could face devastating effects, such as food shortages, water stress, and unstable ecosystems, due to rising global temperatures. In response to these challenges, Equator plans to invest in startups that offer innovative solutions to combat climate change across sub-Saharan Africa. Equator's strategy is to back startups that have the potential to scale up their operations and become profitable over the long term. The firm will offer its portfolio companies mentorship, strategic guidance, and access to its network of investors and partners. Equator's funding round comes as climate tech investment rises globally. According to data from Pitchbook, climate tech investment rose by 800% between 2013 and 2019, reaching $16.3bn in 2019. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for investments in climate tech as governments and investors across the world examine ways to create a cleaner and more sustainable future. The pandemic has also shown the vulnerability of many industries to systemic shocks and has led to a renewed focus on building resiliency in economies. Equator, in partnership with other investors, hopes to contribute to building a more sustainable future and create a more prosperous and resilient sub-Saharan Africa. If the firm's strategy proves successful, it could spark more interest in climate tech investments across Africa and beyond, as investors look for opportunities to make a positive impact while generating returns.
