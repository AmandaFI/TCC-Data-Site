Walmart has taken another step towards meeting the growing demand for smart home technology by partnering with in-home services provider Angi. The retail giant aims to offer customers installation and assembly services for a wide range of smart devices, TVs, and other gadgets. The new service, set to launch in mid-February, will be available for order from nearly 4,000 Walmart stores as well as the company's website. Customers can choose from more than 150 "common home projects" provided by Angi. Prices for services will range from $49 for simple tasks like furniture assembly to $79 for TV mounting. However, more complex projects, such as installing new floors, will require custom quotes. According to Angi, the third most popular project conducted by their team in 2021 was smart home device installations. While many smart home devices are designed for easy installation by customers themselves, certain products like video doorbells, smart locks, and garage door openers often require technical and electrical expertise. Customers may prefer to pay for professional assistance rather than risk making mistakes themselves. It is worth noting that other smart home companies, including Google and Ring, also have partnerships with installation providers. Walmart's partnership with Angi marks the first collaboration between the in-home services provider and a major retailer, giving Walmart a competitive edge in the market. Walmart's website already offers TV mounting services through HelloTech and tech installation services provided by True Network Solutions. The addition of Angi's services will further expand the options available to customers, who can now rely on Walmart to not only provide them with smart home devices but also offer professional installation and assembly. As the demand for smart home technology continues to grow, Walmart is making strategic moves to position itself as a one-stop-shop for all home automation needs. By partnering with established installation providers like Angi, the retail giant is ensuring customers can have their devices installed correctly and efficiently, saving them time and potential frustration. With the launch of this new service just around the corner, Walmart is aiming to solidify its position in the smart home industry and provide customers with a complete solution for their home automation needs.
