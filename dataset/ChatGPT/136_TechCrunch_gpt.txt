AI-generated chart toppers, Apple gets into savings, and Microsoft drops Twitter. TechCrunch's weekly newsletter, Week in Review (WiR), provided a roundup of the past week's tech news. The most-read item was about an AI-generated song called "Heart on My Sleeve," featuring the voices of Drake and The Weeknd, that has become a hit. The song was generated by OpenAI's Jukebox, an AI system trained on millions of songs and capable of creating new ones. While machine-generated music is not new, the success of "Heart on My Sleeve" has raised new questions about the future of the music industry. Some argue that AI-generated music is a threat to human creativity and could lead to a homogenization of popular music. Others see it as a tool for artists, allowing them to create new songs more quickly and efficiently. Regardless of its potential impact, "Heart on My Sleeve" has shown that AI-generated music can be popular and commercially successful. In other news, Apple launched a savings account for US Apple Card customers in partnership with Goldman Sachs. The account, called Apple Card Family, allows up to five family members to use a shared credit line and build credit together. The account also offers cashback rewards on purchases and a competitive APY (annual percentage yield). Apple has also been considering allowing people to sideload apps on iPhones, which would allow users to install apps from outside the App Store. This move would be a significant departure from Apple's current policy, which requires all apps to be vetted and approved by the company. While sideloading could give iPhone users more control over their devices, it could also pose security risks if users download malicious apps. In addition, the Apple Watch's operating system will receive its biggest update yet. The new version of watchOS introduces new health features, such as the ability to track respiratory rate while sleeping. It also includes new watch faces and improvements to messaging and fitness tracking. Meanwhile, Microsoft has dropped Twitter from its advertising platform. The decision was made in response to concerns about the social media platform's content moderation practices. Microsoft will no longer display ads on Twitter, although it still advertises on other social media platforms such as Facebook and LinkedIn. Finally, Snap has opened up its AI chatbot to a global audience, offering new functionality. The chatbot, called "Snap Minis," allows third-party developers to create mini-apps that can be integrated into Snapchat. The new functionality includes the ability to order food, buy movie tickets, and plan a trip, all from within the Snapchat app. In other tech news, Tesla has cut the price of its Model 3 and Model Y electric vehicles for the second time this month. The price cuts are likely an attempt to boost sales as demand for electric vehicles continues to increase. Overall, the past week has been eventful in the world of tech. From AI-generated chart toppers to new banking products and chatbot functionality, there is no shortage of innovation and disruption. As technology continues to shape our world, it will be interesting to see what the future holds.
