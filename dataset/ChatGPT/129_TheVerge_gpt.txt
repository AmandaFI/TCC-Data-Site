Apple's highly anticipated VR/AR headset might run modified versions of iPad apps and offer millions of pre-existing apps through the App Store, according to a report by Bloomberg. The report also claimed the device's home screen and control centre would be similar to that of the iPad, with familiar functionality for those already familiar with the device. TheÂ headset, expected to retail for around $3,000, may also come equipped with advanced hand and eye tracking, iris scanning for secure login and payment and a digital crown, which could allow users to enter and exit virtual reality. Apple is expected to launch the device at the Worldwide Developers' Conference on 5 June, where it is aiming to make a splash in an increasingly crowded VR market. Despite the expected cost, market analysts believe the Apple-branded headset could make a significant impact in the sector, given the level of innovation and investment the company pours into its research and development. Apple reportedly has a team of several hundred engineers, some sourced from Google and Microsoft, working on the headset, with CEO Tim Cook stating previously that he believes AR/VR will be as big as smartphones. The device is expected to take advantage of Apple's expertise in AR, powering iPhones and iPads, as well as using the company's relationship with app developers and the existing infrastructure of the App Store to rapidly populate the device with content.
