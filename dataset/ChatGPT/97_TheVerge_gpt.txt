Modular laptop company Framework is hoping to make waves in the industry by bringing back snap-on removable batteries. The company recently released design specifications for its latest product, the Framework Laptop 16, on GitHub, which suggest that the device will have the option to use two batteries, as well as a graphics card module and a discreet module with additional fans or SSDs. Framework is aiming to create a truly modular laptop that can be customized and upgraded by users as their needs change. To achieve this, the company has designed the Framework Laptop 16 with a large input module city that can accommodate a range of different modular options. These modules can be easily snapped on and off the laptop, allowing users to add new features or upgrade existing ones as needed. One of the most exciting features of the Framework Laptop 16 is the possibility of using two batteries. The laptop will feature 148 contacts in the Expansion Bay daughterboard, which will allow power and data to be fed from the Expansion Bay back into the laptop in an extended battery scenario. This means that users could potentially double the battery life of their laptop by adding a second battery module. In addition to the battery options, the Framework Laptop 16 will also support up to eight lanes of PCI-Express for GPU and SSDs, and will be able to handle up to 210W of power. This makes the laptop a powerful and versatile device that can handle a wide range of different tasks. The modular design of the Framework Laptop 16 is also designed to encourage innovation and collaboration. The company has released the documentation for the laptop on GitHub, allowing others to work on developing new modular parts for the ecosystem. This could potentially lead to a wide range of new and innovative modules, expanding the functionality of the laptop even further. One potential downside to the modular design of the Framework Laptop 16 is that it may be more expensive than traditional laptops. Modular components tend to be more expensive than integrated ones, and the cost of building a laptop with a range of modular options could be prohibitively high for some users. However, Framework has not yet released pricing information for the laptop, so it remains to be seen how much it will cost. Despite the potential cost, the Framework Laptop 16 is an exciting development in the world of modular laptops. By offering users the ability to customize and upgrade their laptop as their needs change, Framework is hoping to create a device that will last longer and be more versatile than traditional laptops. With its focus on collaboration and innovation, the Framework ecosystem could potentially lead to a new wave of modular laptops that offer users unprecedented flexibility and functionality.
