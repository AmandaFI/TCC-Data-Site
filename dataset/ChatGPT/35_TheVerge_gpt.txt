DJI, the world’s leader in civilian drones and aerial imaging technology, has made a splash in the film industry once again with the launch of its newest model, the Inspire 3 mega drone. Aimed at commercial 8K-movie-making, the Inspire 3 offers unprecedented quality and features for professionals in the field. The new drone boasts an upgraded and more aerodynamic design, as well as a longer battery life, with a maximum active time of 28 minutes, compared to its predecessor, the Inspire 2, which had a maximum active time of 25 minutes. The Inspire 3 is bundled with a range of new accessories, all designed to aid in capturing the perfect shot, such as a wireless video transmitter and a special gimbal for smoother camera operation. The star of the show, however, is the Zenmuse X9-8K Air cinema camera, the lightest CineCore 3.0 full-frame system that DJI has ever produced. The Zenmuse X9-8K Air is specifically designed for aerial cinematography, with a large Super35 CMOS sensor that captures a resolution of 8192 x 4320 pixels. Importantly, the X9-8K Air supports 8K CinemaDNG video recording at 25 fps and can record in Apple ProRes RAW format, which is currently one of the highest quality video codecs available. Both CinemaDNG and ProRes RAW recording modes, however, require a $979 license key to unlock them, which may come as a blow to professionals who were expecting a fully equipped cinema drone at the hefty $16,499 price point. Nonetheless, the DJI Inspire 3 is a powerful and versatile tool for filmmakers looking to capture stunning 8K footage from above. “The Inspire 3 is the most exciting release from DJI for the film industry in years,” according to David Kay, a professional filmmaker who recently tested the product. “The camera alone offers an unprecedented level of image quality, and combined with the drone’s features, it’s truly a game-changer for those in the business of aerial cinematography.”. The Zenmuse X9-8K Air camera on the Inspire 3 features an integrated mechanical shutter, which eliminates the rolling shutter effect that can make footage look distorted, especially when capturing fast-moving subjects. It also features a high dynamic range (HDR) mode, which captures more detail in both the highlights and shadows of an image, allowing filmmakers to have greater control in post-production. In addition, the Zenmuse X9-8K Air has a new active cooling system, which helps to regulate the temperature of the camera during prolonged use in warm conditions, ensuring that there is no overheating and resulting in smoother operation and longer life for the unit. The DJI Inspire 3 also includes DJI’s latest image transmission technology, the DJI Focus system, which enables smooth and stable monitoring of live video footage from the drone’s camera. The wireless video transmitter offers seamless streaming of 1080p video at up to 10 km range, even in challenging environments. With the new drone also comes a revamped flight control system, which is designed to be more intuitive and user-friendly for professionals. The drone’s advanced obstacle avoidance system means that it can avoid obstacles while flying autonomously, ensuring a safer experience and more stable footage. “The Inspire 3 is a prime example of DJI’s commitment to innovation in the aerial imaging industry,” said Michael Perry, DJI’s Managing Director, North America. “We’ve listened to feedback from professional filmmakers and incorporated their suggestions into the design of the Inspire 3, making it the ultimate tool for capturing jaw-dropping aerial footage.”. The DJI Inspire 3 is priced at $16,499 and is available now for purchase on the DJI website and through authorized DJI retailers. With its unmatched features and quality, it is sure to be a hit with professional aerial filmmakers looking to push their creativity to new heights.
