Two members of Google's Ethical AI group have left the company to join Timnit Gebru's nonprofit research institute, Distributed AI Research (DAIR). Senior researcher Alex Hanna and software engineer Dylan Baker made the move, with Hanna criticizing the "toxic" work environment at Google and pointing out the lack of representation of Black women within the company. Hanna stated that prior to Gebru's hiring, Google Research management had never recruited a Black woman as a research scientist. She also mentioned an executive remarking that the low number of Black women in the Google Research organization prevented them from presenting employee dissatisfaction results in a town hall. Timnit Gebru, the former co-lead of Google's AI Ethical research group, made headlines in 2020 when she was fired by the company for co-authoring a research paper that raised concerns about Google Search's risks regarding large-scale language models. Another AI ethics researcher, Margaret Mitchell, was also fired for her involvement in the paper. Google's diversity report indicated an increase in the number of Black employees hired, but there was still an increase in the number of women of color leaving the company. This prompted the Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) in California to launch an investigation into Google's treatment of Black female workers in December. The departure of Alex Hanna and Dylan Baker from Google to join Distributed AI Research (DAIR) under Timnit Gebru's leadership further highlights the ongoing issues within the company regarding diversity and inclusivity. Hanna's criticism of the work environment and lack of representation is significant, especially given her position as a senior researcher. In response to the departures, Google spokesperson Brian Gabriel expressed appreciation for Hanna and Baker's contributions and reiterated the company's commitment to building a diverse and inclusive company. Google has made efforts to improve diversity within its ranks, but the recent departures and DFEH investigation demonstrate that there is still progress to be made. Timnit Gebru's nonprofit research institute, DAIR, aims to advance the field of AI while prioritizing ethical considerations. With the addition of Hanna and Baker, the institute gains valuable expertise and support in their ongoing efforts. The departure of two members from Google's Ethical AI group to join DAIR sends a strong message about the need for change within the tech industry. As discussions around AI ethics and the responsibilities of tech companies continue to grow, it is crucial to have diverse voices shaping the conversation. The moves by Hanna and Baker further exemplify the ongoing challenges faced by Black women within the tech industry, highlighting the urgent need for greater representation and a more inclusive work environment.
