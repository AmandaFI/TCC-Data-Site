Ikea has expanded its use of autonomous drones to count inventory across more of its stores in Europe. The Swedish furniture giant has deployed 100 drones from Verity, a drone-making company, in 16 locations in Belgium, Croatia, Slovenia, Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands. The drones, which are used during nonoperational hours, capture images, videos, and 3D depth scans of pallets in the warehouse before downloading collected data. By scanning and analyzing the warehouse, it provides crucial data on inventory levels, ultimately improving the accuracy of product availability. "We're honored to be working with one of the world's most successful and iconic brands," said Maarten Van Speybroeck, Verity's CEO. "The Ikea deployment is one of the largest drone programs happening in retail today. Verity is proud to not only save the Ikea team time and money but provide a safer work environment for all.". By using advanced tools like drones and robots, Ikea is improving employee wellbeing, lowering operational costs, and making its stores more affordable and convenient for customers. Not only does it save employees from manual stock counting, but it allows them to perform other tasks that require a human touch, like customer interactions. Ikea has also experimented with radio-controlled robots in Croatia to fulfill orders and has employed an automated racking system in its store in California. These efforts come as the retailer aims to reduce its carbon footprint and adopt more sustainable practices. "We consistently invest in new technology to help us improve efficiency and sustainability," said Robby Wieringa, logistics development manager at Ikea. "We're committed to leveraging the latest innovations to make shopping at Ikea as convenient and accessible as possible for our customers.". The deployment of Verity's drones is part of Ikea's ongoing efforts to make its supply chain more efficient and sustainable. By improving inventory accuracy, Ikea can reduce food waste and boost customer satisfaction. With the global pandemic accelerating e-commerce adoption, the use of robotics and automation helps Ikea compete in a changing retail landscape. Verity's drones are just one of many technological innovations that Ikea is exploring to streamline its business operations. With the expansion of this initiative to more of its stores, Ikea is showing that it is committed to improving its supply chain processes, reducing costs, and ultimately providing better service to its customers.
