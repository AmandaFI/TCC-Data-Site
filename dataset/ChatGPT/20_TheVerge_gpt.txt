Levi’s will test AI-generated clothing models to ‘increase diversity’. Levi’s, the American clothing company, has revealed that it plans to test AI-generated clothing models as part of its bid to boost diversity and inclusivity. The move will see the digital fashion studio Lalaland.ai working with Levi’s to develop AI models aimed at representing as many sizes, skin tones, ages, and body types as possible. A spokesperson for the company has stated that the use of AI models will not replace real models but rather serve as an additional means of showcasing the brand’s products. At present, clothing is modelled on a single individual on Levi’s website and app. While this has been the norm for many years, it has been criticised for ignoring the diversity of the customer base. By employing AI models, the company hopes to increase inclusivity by presenting a range of body shapes and sizes in a virtual fashion setting. Customers will then be able to view products on models fitting their own body types, rather than on a single predetermined figure. The use of AI models has been touted as a means of enhancing the online shopping experience for consumers. The digital models will be able to show how Levi’s products look on a range of different body types, as well as providing a more immersive experience for customers. The company states that the AI technology should help customers better visualise themselves in the brand’s clothing, thus building a stronger connection to the products. “We’re excited to see what Lalaland.ai can bring to the table in terms of creating digital models that more accurately reflect the diverse range of customers we see every day,” said a spokesperson for Levi’s. “We believe that the use of AI will help us to create a more inclusive and immersive shopping experience, while also highlighting the range of Levi’s products available to our customers.”. Despite the adoption of AI models, Levi’s has continually denied that it will be scaling back the use of real models or live photoshoots. The use of AI should not be considered as a commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion but rather as an additional tool to enhance the brand’s online presence. Customers will still be able to experience different products on real models, as before. The use of AI models is becoming an increasingly important trend in the fashion industry, as many brands look to reflect the diversity of consumers more accurately. By using AI, companies can create digital models in a much shorter time frame, and at a much lower cost, than traditional photoshoots. Additionally, AI models can be created to fit any specific size, shape, and colour, making it easier to present the clothing in a variety of contexts. The use of AI models is also seen as a more sustainable way of creating visual content, as it eliminates the need for unnecessary travel and production. In the current era of digital shopping, customer experience is vital to the success of any brand. By using AI models, Levi’s hopes to create a seamless and immersive retail experience for customers, as well as reflecting the diversity of its customer base. In doing so, it can not only increase customer engagement but also remain relevant in a highly competitive market. The use of AI-generated models is an interesting way for the brand to break away from its traditional retail strategy and embrace the potential of emerging technologies.
