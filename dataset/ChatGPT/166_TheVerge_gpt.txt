Targus, a company specializing in designing products for germ-free living during the pandemic, has unveiled its latest offering, the Cypress Hero EcoSmart Backpack. This backpack is specifically targeted towards iPhone users and comes equipped with Apple's Find My technology, allowing users to track a lost iPhone by simply pressing a button on the backpack. Unlike traditional tracking tags, the backpack features an integrated replaceable battery that can be recharged via USB, providing enhanced protection against theft. In addition to its advanced tracking capabilities, the Cypress Hero EcoSmart backpack is also environmentally friendly. It is made from approximately 26 recycled water bottles, making it a sustainable choice for conscious consumers. Although Targus has not yet provided a specific release date for the backpack, it plans to launch the product in the spring/summer of 2022 with a price tag of $149.99. For consumers who are not iPhone users or prefer not to have built-in tracking technology, Targus has expanded its antimicrobial accessory line at CES 2022. This line caters to the growing demand for productivity, sustainability, and health and wellness initiatives in the pandemic consumer market. Alongside the Cypress Hero EcoSmart Backpack, the line includes various other backpacks, a briefcase, slipcase, and laptop sleeve. In addition to these new products, Targus has also introduced the USB-C Hybrid/Universal 4K Quad Dock. Compatible with multiple operating systems, including Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and Chrome OS, this dock supports single-display 8K resolution output or up to four 4K displays. The Dock720 variant will be available this month, priced at $442.99. Additionally, Targus will offer a Dock710 variant without enterprise-grade biometrics capabilities for $372.99. Lastly, Targus announced that its UV-C LED Disinfection Light, previously unveiled at CES 2021, is now "the world's first certified disinfection unit for commercial use under UL 962." This disinfection light, designed specifically to keep keyboards clean, will hit the market in February at a price of $299.99. With its new range of products, Targus continues to innovate and offer solutions to consumers looking for germ-free and sustainable options during the ongoing pandemic. Whether it's through built-in tracking technology, antimicrobial accessories, or disinfection lights, Targus aims to meet the needs of a changing world.
