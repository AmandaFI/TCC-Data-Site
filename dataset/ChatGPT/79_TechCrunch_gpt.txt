Parents across the country are expressing concern and frustration as technology company iD Tech remains silent weeks after a data breach in which hackers stole the personal data of thousands of users. The company, which provides coding and tech courses for kids both on-campus and online, has yet to acknowledge the breach or notify affected families. Details of the hack were revealed by a hacker on a cybercrime forum, who claimed to have stolen close to 1 million user records from iD Tech. The stolen data includes users' names, dates of birth, and passwords - all stored in plaintext - as well as around 415,000 unique email addresses. It has also been reported that the data breach notification services obtained the data and sent out notifications to affected families, while others were notified by Firefox or their device security software. However, some parents have yet to receive any notification from iD Tech. One parent expressed concern, stating that breached data was only a small portion of the data iD Tech collects on account holders and children. This includes personal details such as gender, billing information, and some health data, raising further concerns about the scale of the breach and the possible impact on affected families. Despite the growing concern among parents, iD Tech has remained tight-lipped about the breach, declining to explain why they have not yet acknowledged the hack or sent out notifications to affected families. The company also declined to provide a copy of the communication that they claim to have sent to parents. While it is unclear whether or not iD Tech has reported the breach to offices of state attorneys general as required per data breach notification laws, many parents are calling on the company to take immediate action. Concerns over data privacy and security have heightened in recent years, and this breach highlights the urgent need for companies to take proactive steps to safeguard user data. Parents have expressed their urgency for iD Tech to address this issue as soon as possible, with one stating, “We are all very concerned about why iD Tech is remaining silent on this issue. It is unacceptable for a company that claims to be providing tech education to children to be so careless with their data privacy and security. We want iD Tech to take responsibility for this breach and to provide clear communication to all affected families.”. As technology continues to advance and more individuals rely on online services and platforms, companies must prioritize the protection of user data. The iD Tech breach serves as a sobering reminder of the risks associated with online platforms and the urgent need for companies to take proactive measures to protect user privacy and security.
