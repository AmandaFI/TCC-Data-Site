Elon Musk, the founder of electric car company Tesla and space exploration firm SpaceX, reportedly attempted to take control of OpenAI in 2018 in a bid to prevent the AI lab falling behind Google. However, he was rejected by other founders including CEO Sam Altman and President Greg Brockman. Musk had reportedly offered to take direct control of the company himself, but was rebuffed by his colleagues. . OpenAI is an artificial intelligence research lab founded in 2015 by Musk, Altman, Brockman and other tech luminaries. It was created with the aim of democratizing AI research and preventing the technology from being monopolized by a small number of companies. Musk was a member of OpenAI's board from its inception, but resigned in 2018 citing a conflict of interest with his work at Tesla. . According to a report from Semafor, when Musk left OpenAI's board, he also reneged on a promise to supply $1 billion in funding to the lab, contributing only $100 million before leaving. This left OpenAI with a funding problem, which was later solved when it created a for-profit entity and received billions in funding and resources from Microsoft. . However, many in the AI community view OpenAI's turn toward corporate interests as a betrayal of its founding principles. Since becoming involved with Microsoft, the lab has been rapidly launching AI services and products, and Microsoft has been integrating OpenAI's technology into its Windows operating system and Office suite. But many AI experts argue that shutting down access to OpenAI's models makes it harder for the community to understand potential threats posed by these systems. . Musk has been a vocal critic of OpenAI since it became more closely associated with Microsoft, arguing that the company has become a "closed source, maximum-profit company effectively controlled by Microsoft." In a tweet from February this year, he expressed his dismay at the trajectory OpenAI has taken. . The reports highlight the struggle between those pushing for democratization of AI, and those who believe that corporate interests are the best way to ensure the technology achieves its full potential. Musk, who has long argued that AI poses a major threat to humanity, has invested heavily in AI companies that embrace open access, including DeepMind and Vicarious. . OpenAI's decision to shift its focus toward commercial applications of AI has also prompted criticism from researchers within the company. In April this year, OpenAI researcher Dario Amodei resigned, citing concerns about the company's business model. Amodei argued that the company's commercial interests were leading it to prioritize short-term gains rather than long-term societal benefits. . The debate over OpenAI's direction reflects wider tensions within the field of AI. Some argue that the most effective way to develop powerful AI systems is through collaboration between researchers, while others contend that commercial interests are necessary to drive innovation. However, there is growing support for the idea that AI should be developed and deployed in a way that is transparent and accountable to the wider public. The concern is that as AI becomes increasingly powerful, and more widely deployed, it may be used for nefarious purposes, or fall into the wrong hands. . For his part, Musk appears to be doubling down on his efforts to promote open access to AI. Earlier this year, he announced the formation of a new AI lab called OpenAI Gym, which is designed to promote collaboration and transparency in AI research. The lab provides a platform for researchers to share code and data, and encourages the development of novel AI algorithms and applications. The goal is to create an ecosystem of AI that is open, accessible and accountable, and to prevent the monopolization of this powerful technology by a small number of companies. . Overall, the story of Musk's failed attempt to take control of OpenAI highlights the tension within the field of AI between those who believe that the technology should be developed in an open, transparent and collaborative manner, and those who argue that the commercial interests of companies are necessary to drive innovation. The question of how best to regulate and govern the development and deployment of AI systems is likely to remain a contentious issue for years to come.
