The UK government has announced plans for legislation aimed at curbing the market power of big tech companies. The new rules, which are set to be introduced soon, will give the Digital Markets Unit (DMU) greater powers to oversee tech platforms with "strategic market status." This approach is different from that of the EU, which focuses on prescribing lists of operational dos and don'ts. Under the new legislation, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) will have the power to enforce consumer law directly, rather than having to go through lengthy court processes. This is aimed at cutting the time it takes for competition intervention. The bill will also ban fake online reviews and ensure web users can easily extricate themselves from unwanted contracts. The legislation could have broader implications for big tech companies currently operating in the UK. The government has not yet announced a timeline for when the regulations will be introduced. The announcement comes after a year-long review by the CMA which concluded that the UK's competition laws need to be updated to better protect consumers from the market dominance of big tech firms. This review looked at Google and Facebook, but the new legislation is likely to apply to all tech companies with over 10% market share in their respective sectors. The aims of the legislation include ensuring a level playing field for competition, greater consumer protection, and safeguarding the interests of businesses that rely on tech platforms to reach their customers. Digital Secretary Oliver Dowden said: "Today’s proposals are landmark reforms that will help ensure consumers and small businesses aren’t pushed around or disadvantaged by powerful tech companies. The Digital Markets Unit will oversee plans to give consumers more choice and control over their data, promote online competition and crack down on unfair practices which can often leave businesses and consumers with less choice and more expensive goods and services.". The CMA welcomed the new legislation, with Chief Executive Andrea Coscelli saying: "The Digital Markets Unit will have a range of powers to tackle the sources of potential harm that can arise from Google and Facebook's dominance, including the imposition of fines for non-compliance, the power to impose interoperability requirements and the ability to order the separation of different businesses. With this new regime, we can ensure that consumers will be better protected, and the digital economy continues to thrive in the UK.". While big tech companies have previously faced regulatory scrutiny, this new legislation signals a more comprehensive approach to their market power. It remains to be seen how the companies will respond to these new rules, but it is possible that they may challenge them in court. The UK government's approach to competition reform is designed to be targeted and tailored to each tech giant in its sights, rather than relying on one-size-fits-all regulations. This approach is motivated by a concern that big tech companies operate in a rapidly-evolving sector, and that overly-prescriptive regulation could stifle innovation. The legislation has been welcomed by consumer groups, who have long called for greater protections against the market power of big tech. Which? Executive Director Richard Lloyd said: "We welcome government action to create a new regulator to address the dominance of tech giants, which is long overdue. For too long, consumers have been faced with a harmful lack of competition and misleading practices from tech giants that have been allowed to act with impunity. This new regulator must hit the ground running to ensure people are protected and competition flourishes online.". Whichever way the legislation is received, it is clear that the UK government is keen to assert greater control over the tech sector, in line with many other countries around the world. As the digital economy continues to grow and evolve, governments will be under increasing pressure to ensure that they are able to protect consumers and businesses alike. With the introduction of this new legislation, the UK government has taken a significant step towards achieving this goal.
