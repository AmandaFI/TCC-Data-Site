WhatsApp users can now sign into the messaging app on up to four devices, including multiple phones, thanks to the app's newly enabled multi-device login support feature. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced this latest update on Instagram and Facebook, revealing that it would be rolling out to devices over the coming weeks. Previously, WhatsApp users could only use one account on one phone, along with multiple desktop devices. The company was hesitant about enabling multi-device support due to the app's end-to-end encryption protection. However, WhatsApp has now developed a system that maintains the encryption protection while allowing for multiple device sign-ins. The process is achieved through a combination of renowned security protocols, allowing users to have a secure messaging experience across all devices. WhatsApp competitors, like Messenger and Telegram, had previously offered multi-device synchronization; however, their security systems did not match WhatsApp's encryption protection. Many of these competitors had allowed users to stay logged into the web and desktop apps even after logging out of the mobile app. By comparison, WhatsApp had to maintain privacy and prevent any hacking attempts through authentication on each device. With the new feature, users will be able to use their WhatsApp account across four linked devices seamlessly. They can choose which devices will receive notifications for the messages they receive and can message other WhatsApp accounts that do not support multi-device support. This update is set to be a significant boost for WhatsApp in its ongoing battle with other messaging apps. The multi-device feature has been one of the users' most requested features for years and will undoubtedly attract more users to the platform. With the feature now rolling out globally over the next few weeks, WhatsApp expects the number of active users on its app to continue to soar. The app's new multi-device feature is undoubtedly a game-changer, allowing users to make more use of the app across multiple devices.
