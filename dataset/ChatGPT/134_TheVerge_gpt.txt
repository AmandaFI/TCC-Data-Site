iRobotâ€™s Roomba can now be a security camera. iRobot, the company known for making robotic vacuums, has just launched a new beta feature that allows the latest version of their Roomba j7 series to act as a home security camera. The new feature, called Remote Check In, lets users watch live video of their homes from the j7 Combo robot vacuum. The feature is only available in the US and can be accessed on iOS devices. While other robot vacuum manufacturers such as Samsung's JetBot AI and Ecovacs' models already offer live video cameras, the Roomba j7 series differentiates itself by having AI-powered obstacle avoidance technology. This means users can send the robot to any part of their home while taking the live video. . The Remote Check In camera feature is not a replacement for traditional security cameras, as it does not provide motion detectors, audio, two-way communication, or the ability to pan and tilt the camera. However, it is an additional layer of security that can give users peace of mind. The view provided by the Roomba j7 series is also limited to a few inches above the floor. Therefore, while the camera is great for spotting low-level threats, it won't be capable of recognizing events happening at a higher level. Users concerned about their privacy can turn off the camera function, which is only activated after opting into the beta service. When the live view is turned on, the robot vacuum's LED turns green, and an audible ping sounds every few seconds to inform people that the camera is operating. The Roomba j7 series also features an extended runtime of up to 75 minutes without needing a charge. The vacuum is equipped with a smart charging dock that takes up less floor space and requires fewer cleanings than other docks. The Roomba j7 series also features iRobot's new Clean Zones technology, which allows users to create rectangular areas on the app's map that require a more thorough cleaning. Users can also customize their robot's cleaning preferences for different rooms and zones in their homes. There is no doubt that robotic vacuums are a game-changer in the cleaning world. However, the Roomba j7 series's Remote Check In camera feature is a significant new development that will transform how users view their robotic vacuum cleaners. While the Roomba j7 series may not replace traditional home security cameras, it does represent a new kind of home security device that is incredibly convenient, easy to use, and can be accessed from anywhere with an iOS device. The Roomba j7 series offers users an additional level of security and peace of mind that can be invaluable in today's world. As with all beta features, iRobot is still testing the Remote Check In camera's capabilities and is likely to make changes based on customer feedback. However, thus far, the feature has been well-received by users who appreciate the additional convenience and security it provides. In conclusion, iRobot's Roomba j7 series is a significant step forward for both robotic vacuums and home security devices. While there are some limitations to the camera feature, it is an impressive addition that can provide users with real-time information about what is happening in their homes. Overall, the Roomba j7 series represents an exciting development in technology that is worth checking out.
