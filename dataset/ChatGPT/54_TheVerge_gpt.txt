Atari, the video game company that brought us classics such as Pong and Space Invaders, is set to acquire Nightdive Studios, a specialist in remaking classic games such as Quake and Doom 64. The deal, worth $10 million, is expected to help Atari "enrich its large library of owned IP, leverage Night Dive’s proprietary technology, and utilize Night Dive’s publishing capabilities to support Atari’s retro-focused growth strategy," according to a statement from the company. Nightdive Studios, based in Vancouver, has won acclaim for its enhanced remasters of some of the most iconic games of the 1990s and early 2000s, including Turok: Dinosaur Hunter, Strife: Veteran Edition, and the upcoming System Shock remake, which is being developed with input and support from the original game's creator, Warren Spector. Atari's acquisition of Nightdive is the latest move in the company's efforts to capitalize on the wave of nostalgia for classic games among fans who grew up with the company's early offerings. Earlier this year, Atari released a retro game collection, Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration, which included 50 of the company's most beloved games, including Centipede, Missile Command, and Yars' Revenge. Wade Rosen, Atari CEO, already owns 13 percent of Nightdive Studios, and the acquisition is expected to give Atari access to the studio's proprietary technology for enhancing and updating classic games, as well as its publishing capabilities. Atari is hoping that Nightdive's expertise will help it create more compelling remasters of its own classic titles, and possibly even new titles that harken back to the company's glory days. In addition to the deal with Nightdive, Atari has been expanding its portfolio of licensed intellectual property, which includes popular video game franchises such as RollerCoaster Tycoon, Test Drive, and Alone in the Dark. The company has also been exploring new markets, including blockchain technology and online gambling. The news of Atari's acquisition of Nightdive has been met with excitement from fans and industry observers alike, who see it as a positive sign that classic games are once again finding new life in the modern gaming landscape. Atari has promised to continue investing in retro-focused gaming experiences, and it seems that Nightdive will be an important part of that effort going forward.
