Ampersand, a startup based in San Francisco that specializes in aiding SaaS companies with their user-facing integrations, has announced that it has raised $4.7 million in seed funding. The funding round was led by Matrix Partners, and included participation from Base Case Capital, Flex Capital and 2.12 Angels, in addition to a range of angel investors. The company's platform assists engineers in developing user-facing integrations for their SaaS applications, providing a more flexible and configurable experience than what is currently available through traditional unified APIs. The platform also supplies tools for the entire integration lifecycle, from development to testing to management. Ampersand has already worked with some design partners with the aim of eventually monetising the service in the next two quarters. Their service has been very well-received, with many commenting on its ease of use and flexibility. Responses have been positive across the board, with many customers already stating that they will continue to use the company's service. Ampersand was co-founded by Danny Robinson and Harrison Hines, who have prior experience as entrepreneurs and in product development. Robinson, Ampersand's CEO, stated that the latest funding round will be used to further improve the product and to expand its reach. “SaaS businesses have seen massive growth over the past decade, with a 30 percent annual increase in market size. However, the user-facing integrations necessary to support this technical growth have still been relatively stagnant for years. We’re excited to change that with a new product that will allow businesses to deliver a truly seamless experience.”. “We’ve already seen significant traction, and we’re thrilled to have the support of investors who have experience building world-class software companies. We’re focused on building a product that gets out of the way of the user’s experience, and helps SaaS companies better support their end-users.”. One of the main selling points of the Ampersand platform is the ease of use it offers for those without extensive technical experience. By providing customers with a range of user-facing integrations that can be easily configured by non-technical employees, Ampersand enables companies to streamline previously complex processes and provide a better user experience. The company also hopes to play a role in accelerating the progress of the SaaS industry, which has seen rapid growth over the last decade. By providing a product that helps companies support their end-users more effectively, the company is positioning itself as a valuable resource in an already crowded and competitive marketplace. The announcement of the successful funding round comes at a time when the SaaS industry is experiencing a boom, with the ongoing global pandemic driving demand for remote work solutions. As this trend continues, Ampersand is likely to see an increase in demand for its user-friendly integrations, as more companies look to offer better customer experiences in a rapidly-changing business landscape.
