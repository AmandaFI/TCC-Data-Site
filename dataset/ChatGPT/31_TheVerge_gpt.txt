Apple CEO, Tim Cook, has reiterated his belief in the potential of augmented reality (AR) over virtual reality (VR). Cook stated that overlaying the physical world with things from the digital world could "greatly enhance peopleâ€™s communication" and help bring them together. During an interview with Kara Swisher on her podcast Sway, Cook discussed the power of AR to provide people with new ways to communicate and connect, saying, "I'm a big believer in AR. We can use it to enhance our discussion, not substitute it for human connection.". Cook reiterated that AR has huge potential for enhancing communication and connecting people, and mentioned that Apple is working on a product that will incorporate this technology. Apple's rumoured mixed reality headset, which is likely to cost around $3,000, is said to offer copresence technology, with the headset focused on using digital objects in the real world. Cook stated that Apple has been working on AR and VR for years and that the "display technology required, as well as the content creation technology, the processing technology, the sensor technology" and other necessary innovations to make AR and VR work seamlessly need time and investment. Cook addressed the question of why it has taken Apple so long to launch a mixed reality headset, stating that the company wants to control the primary technology and innovate, rather than putting together "pieces of somebody else's stuff.". Cook also highlighted Apple's environmental commitments, privacy focus and work to support better relationships with technology for its users. Apple has been working to reduce its carbon footprint and has pledged to be carbon neutral by 2030. They have also launched a programme called "Giga Texas" that will use renewable energy sources to power their manufacturing facilities. "We believe that businesses have a responsibility to make the world a better place", said Cook. Privacy has also been a focus for Apple, as they have implemented measures such as the App Tracking Transparency feature in iOS 14.5 that requires apps to get user consent before tracking their activity across other apps and websites. Cook believes that individual privacy is a fundamental human right, saying, "It's your information, it's not ours.". Apple has also focused on promoting healthy relationships with technology for its users, with features such as Screen Time and Do Not Disturb designed to limit device usage and reduce distractions. Cook emphasized that Apple's values are not just about making money, but about making a positive impact on the world and empowering people. While Cook did not reveal any further details about Apple's mixed reality headset, his focus on the potential for AR to enhance communication and create connections suggests that the device will be geared towards productivity and collaboration. The headset could be a gamechanger in industries such as design, engineering, education, and healthcare, where the ability to use digital objects in the real world could significantly enhance efficiency and collaboration. Apple has a reputation for delivering products that are not only visually stunning but also intuitive and easy to use. Cook's emphasis on innovation and taking the time to develop the necessary technologies suggests that Apple's mixed reality headset will be no exception. The device is expected to launch in 2022 or 2023, but with no official confirmation from Apple, it remains to be seen exactly what the company has in store. . In conclusion, Cook's interview sheds light on Apple's vision for AR technology and the company's commitment to making a positive impact on the world. As Apple prepares to launch its mixed reality headset, its values of innovation, privacy, and environmental responsibility will be at the forefront. AR and VR have huge potential to enhance communication and create connections, and with Apple's expertise in design and user experience, the company's mixed reality headset is sure to be an exciting addition to the world of technology.
