Tech giant Apple has reportedly acquired AI start-up WaveOne, which developed algorithms for video compression. While Apple has not officially commented on the acquisition, several former WaveOne employees have been recruited to work within the company's machine learning teams. The start-up aimed to revolutionise video codecs, using AI-powered compression algorithms that could run on smartphones, as well as a growing number of personal computers. WaveOne's technology was designed to be "robust to sudden disruptions in connectivity" and independent of hardware, significantly reducing file sizes of videos by up to 50%. WaveOne was founded in 2016 with the goal of improving mobile video quality and the experiences of users with poor network connections. The company developed AI algorithms to compress video in a way that provided high quality, but also took up less storage space and reduced data usage. The technology was designed to work with a variety of devices, making the video experience much smoother and more accessible to people around the world. Apple has always been focused on improving the user experience with its products and services. The acquisition of WaveOne will undoubtedly help the tech giant in its efforts to enhance video performance on its devices. With the rise of online video consumption, it has become increasingly important to optimise video quality and reduce the amount of data and storage needed. WaveOne's technology can achieve this without sacrificing video quality, making it an ideal addition to Apple's arsenal. While Apple has been tight-lipped about the acquisition, the move is not surprising as the company has been investing heavily in AI and machine learning in recent years. The acquisition of WaveOne will bring in a team of experts who will undoubtedly contribute to Apple's efforts to develop smarter and more efficient technologies. In addition to improving the user experience, the use of AI in video compression has significant environmental benefits. By reducing the amount of data and storage needed for video, the technology can decrease the amount of energy used to store and transmit video content. This can have a significant impact on the environment, making it an important area of research and development for tech companies. The acquisition of WaveOne is just one of many moves Apple has made to strengthen its position in the AI and machine learning space. Last year, the company hired prominent AI researcher and professor John Giannandrea to lead its machine learning and AI strategy. Apple has been steadily expanding its AI capabilities, and the acquisition of WaveOne is just the latest example of its commitment to developing smarter, more efficient technologies. Overall, the acquisition of WaveOne is a strategic move by Apple to strengthen its position in the AI and video compression space. With the growing demand for video content, the ability to compress video without sacrificing quality is becoming increasingly important. WaveOne's technology is a step towards achieving this goal, and Apple's acquisition of the start-up brings talented engineers and researchers into its fold. The impact of this acquisition on Apple's products and services remains to be seen, but one thing is certain â€“ the company is doubling down on AI and machine learning, and the future looks bright.
