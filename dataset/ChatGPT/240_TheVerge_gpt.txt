Snap, the parent company of popular social media platform Snapchat, has made a strategic move towards the future of augmented reality (AR) glasses by acquiring NextMind, a Paris-based neurotech startup. NextMind has pioneered a headband that enables users to control certain functions of a computer using their thoughts. The technology developed by NextMind will be incorporated into Snap's upcoming versions of Spectacles, its own AR glasses. NextMind's first product, the headband developer kit, will be discontinued following the acquisition. However, the employees of NextMind will join Snap Lab, the hardware division within Snap responsible for the development of Spectacles. The financial specifics of the acquisition have not been disclosed by either company. Snap's acquisition of NextMind is part of its broader strategy to delve deeper into the world of AR hardware. The company has been expanding its reach in this field through previous acquisitions, including AR display-maker WaveOptics and display tech company Compound Photonics. Snap's interest in brain-computer interfaces aligns with the initiatives undertaken by other major tech companies. Elon Musk's Neuralink, Valve's collaboration with OpenBCI, and Facebook's acquisition of CTRL-Labs have all demonstrated a keen interest in exploring the potential of brain-computer interfaces. The technology behind NextMind's headband relies on non-invasive sensors attached to the user's head to measure brain activity. This data is then used to interpret the user's focused attention, allowing them to control devices merely by thinking. This approach differs from the electromyography technique employed by CTRL-Labs, which measures muscle activity. Snap's acquisition of NextMind is viewed as a long-term research investment that signifies the company's dedication to developing innovative control mechanisms for its AR glasses. By acquiring NextMind and integrating its cutting-edge technology into Spectacles, Snap aims to position itself as a frontrunner in the AR hardware market. The demand for AR glasses and related technologies has grown significantly in recent years, and Snap is eager to seize this opportunity. By incorporating NextMind's brain-computer interface technology, Snap will likely capitalize on the increasing interest in hands-free operation of devices and provide users with a more immersive AR experience. Snap's commitment to AR hardware has been evident through its Spectacles product line. The company has iterated on various versions of the glasses, with each iteration offering enhanced features and capabilities. By incorporating NextMind's technology, Snap aims to revolutionize how users interact with AR content and expand the possibilities of AR beyond visual immersion. With AR technology becoming increasingly sophisticated and integrated into various industries, Snap's push into AR hardware is timely and strategic. By acquiring NextMind and harnessing its brain-computer interface technology, Snap is positioning itself to be at the forefront of this transformative technology, poised to shape the future of AR glasses and user experience. As Snap joins forces with NextMind and continues to invest in AR hardware, users can anticipate exciting advancements that will further bridge the gap between the physical and digital worlds.
