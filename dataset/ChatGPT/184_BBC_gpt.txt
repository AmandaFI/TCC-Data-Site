74% of Ransomware Revenue Goes to Russia-Linked Hackers, According to Analysis. A new analysis conducted by Chainalysis has revealed that a whopping 74% of all money generated through ransomware attacks in 2021 was received by hackers affiliated with Russia. The study identified over $400 million in cryptocurrency payments that were funneled to groups believed to have strong ties to the country. These findings lend credence to the prevailing belief that numerous cybercriminal organizations operate within Russia or neighboring countries within the Commonwealth of Independent States. By scrutinizing publicly available transaction records on the blockchain, researchers were successful in tracking the flow of money, allowing them to identify known hacking groups based on distinctive characteristics. However, it is worth noting that the report primarily focused on the money trail leading to the leaders of cybercriminal gangs rather than providing insights into the individual hackers working for these groups. Many of these gangs manage affiliate operations that involve renting out hacking tools to others, making it difficult to ascertain the location of individual hackers. The year 2021 witnessed an international effort to combat ransomware hackers following several high-profile attacks on prominent organizations, including Ireland's health service and a major US oil pipeline. Consequently, a number of alleged hackers were apprehended in countries such as Romania, Ukraine, South Korea, and Kuwait. Furthermore, the United States successfully managed to reclaim millions of dollars from digital wallets linked to ransomware criminals. Russia has consistently denied allegations suggesting that it harbors hackers. Nonetheless, Russian authorities recently announced the dismantling of REvil, a prominent ransomware group, at the US's request, marking a rare instance of collaboration between the two nations in the realm of cybercrime. The Chainalysis report indicates that 9.9% of all identifiable ransomware revenue is channeled to Evil Corp, a cybercrime syndicate operating in Russia that has been both sanctioned and indicted by the US; unexpectedly, the group appears to carry on its activities with impunity. Moreover, the report implicates multiple cryptocurrency businesses located in the prestigious Federation Tower in Moscow City in money laundering practices. Researchers assert that these companies played a crucial role in facilitating the conversion of cryptocurrency into mainstream currency, enabling hackers to launder illicitly obtained funds. Allegedly, between 29% and 48% of funds received by cryptocurrency businesses in Moscow City originate from addresses associated with illicit and high-risk activities. Collectively, the research corroborates the significant involvement of Russia-linked hackers in ransomware attacks and money laundering activities. Despite some measures undertaken against specific groups, the issue remains complex and persistent.
