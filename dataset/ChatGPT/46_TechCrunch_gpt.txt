When the tech IPO market reopens, keep an eye on HR unicorns, advises TechCrunch+. The back half of 2023 is predicted to see several HR tech firms go public, including familiar names such as Rippling, Gusto, and Deel. But one less familiar contender, Velocity Global, with recent growth and profitability, is also expected to enter the HR technology market. TechCrunch+ obtained financial data from Velocity Global CEO Ben Wright, revealing valuable insight into the worth and growth of payroll management startups. The HR tech space is highly nuanced but is showing signs of convergence. There is a divide between companies that manage payroll and those that serve as the employer of record for firms looking to recruit internationally. However, such distinctions are blurring as more companies broaden their product range to cater to more client use cases. Velocity Global CEO Ben Wright disclosed the company’s performance metrics and revealed that the company is expected to be a strong contender for the HR tech IPO market in 2023. Wright said that the company has achieved a two-year compound annual growth rate of 84%, while revenues rose from $13m to $110m over the last four years. Velocity Global provides services such as employer of record, recruiting, and workforce consulting from its offices in more than 185 countries. The firm offers a centralised global payroll solution that eliminates the need for multiple local bank payments, providing an entire picture of the company's international payroll ecosphere. Payroll management is often perceived as a ‘safe and steady’ market. However, some of the biggest HR tech unicorns have emerged in this sector, offering a new era of cloud-based systems and user-friendly solutions. Rippling and Gusto are two such unicorns predicted to go public in 2023. Rippling provides human resource management, benefits administration, and payroll services all on a single system. Gusto provides employee benefits, compliance, and access to human resource experts as well as payroll solutions. These companies are likely to fan further interest in IPOs from the HR tech sector, which has already provided some of the most notable venture capital backed IPO successes of the last few years. Investors would be advised to keep an eye on the broader HR tech space, particularly in managing payroll for firms operating in multiple markets, as this market looks set to reach a new level of maturity, profitability, and growth. The HR tech sector is the source of some of the most exciting innovations in payroll management and user-friendly interfaces, which can attract talent from firms as well as customers looking to streamline their global payroll structures. The HR tech unicorns expected to go public in 2023 look set to capitalise on an increasing need for more holistic approaches to payroll management and related services.
