Snapchat releases My AI chatbot to all users for free. Snapchat has announced that its "My AI" chatbot will be made available to all of the app's 750 million monthly users for free. The chatbot, which is powered by OpenAI, was previously only accessible to Snapchat's paid subscribers. The bot is capable of recommending augmented reality filters and places to visit, but it will also soon enable users to visually message it and receive generated responses. The release of the My AI chatbot is aimed at providing Snapchat users with even more interactive features. With the help of AI technology, the bot can provide relevant information and recommendations based on user preferences. The feature was also intended to be a more personalized form of talking with friends on social media platforms. The launch of the My AI chatbot was met with some criticism when it was first released, mostly related to the bot's potential for inappropriate behavior. However, Snapchat CEO Evan Spiegel stated that the bot's interactions are carefully monitored, and 99.5% of replies have conformed to community guidelines. Snapchat has been working with OpenAI to develop the technology that powers the chatbot. The AI algorithm used in the bot is designed to learn from user behavior and data to provide more personalized recommendations. This means that as more people use the feature, the bot's recommendations are expected to become even more accurate and reflective of individual user preferences. Snapchat users can access the My AI chatbot by simply opening the app and selecting the chat window. The bot can then be added as a contact by entering the username "My AI". Once added, users can interact with the bot by typing in questions or requesting recommendations. The bot will then respond with relevant information and suggestions. The My AI chatbot can also provide users with augmented reality filters based on their preferences and recommendations. This feature is especially useful for users who are new to Snapchat and may not be familiar with all of the app's features. Snapchat has been working to improve the app's functionality and user experience over the past few years. One of its main strategies has been to integrate AI technology into various features to provide more personalized recommendations and suggestions. The My AI chatbot is just one example of this approach, and there are likely to be more AI-powered features in the future. Overall, the release of the My AI chatbot is an exciting development for Snapchat users. With more personalized recommendations, augmented reality filters, and other features, the app is likely to become even more popular in the coming years. While there may be some concerns about the potential for inappropriate behavior, Snapchat's commitment to community guidelines and monitoring should help to mitigate these risks. In the end, the chatbot is a great example of the potential of AI technology to enhance social media platforms and improve user experiences.
