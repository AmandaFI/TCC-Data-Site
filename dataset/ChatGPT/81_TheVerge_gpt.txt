Google and home security leader ADT have launched a new smart security system for customers. The new system, ADT’s Self Setup, can be fully integrated with Google Nest devices such as indoor and outdoor cameras and a video doorbell, all of which can be accessed through Google Home or ADT’s own software. The system, which launched in February, offers continuous monitoring and protection for users' properties. . The Self Setup system is perfect for customers who want to keep an eye on their home and secure their surroundings, but don’t want to spend too much time and money on installation and maintenance. Users can easily install the system themselves using ADT’s step-by-step guide. . "We're excited to expand our partnership with ADT to help more people protect their homes with Nest devices. By working together, we can offer an affordable, easy-to-use smart home security system that connects to the rest of your Google Nest devices," said Rishi Chandra, Vice President of Nest and Home at Google. The smart security system includes a smart hub, which connects to the user's home Wi-Fi network and controls all of the sensors and devices in the system. It also includes a keypad, which can be used to arm and disarm the system whenever the users leave or return home. . The system is compatible with Google Assistant, which means users can control the system using their voice. For example, users can ask Google Assistant to "arm the system" or "check the live feed" from their cameras. . ADT’s Chief Technology Officer, Nigel Clark, said that the Self Setup system was designed to be easy to set up and use, with minimal fuss or expertise. "The Self Setup system offers a simple and convenient way for our customers to protect their homes without having to wait for an appointment for installation," he explained. . The system also includes a mobile app, which allows users to control and monitor their security system from anywhere, at any time. The app provides real-time notifications, so users can quickly respond to any alerts or situations that may arise. . The system costs $24.99 per month for professional monitoring through ADT, which means that if the system is triggered, ADT will respond immediately and send emergency personnel to the user's house to investigate. An additional $10 per month is required for a Nest Aware subscription, which provides access to advanced features such as facial recognition, 24/7 continuous recording, and the ability to set activity zones. . The smart security system is currently available for an introductory price of $380, which includes the smart hub, keypad, motion sensor, and two door/window sensors. However, ADT's Chief Technology Officer, Nigel Clark, has confirmed that a starter package will eventually cost $479.99. . The ADT Self Setup system is a significant addition to the home security market, as it provides a fully integrated smart home security solution for consumers. By combining ADT's expertise in home security with Google's Nest technology, customers can enjoy a seamless and convenient way to protect their homes. . "ADT has a long-standing commitment to innovation and delivering personalized solutions that meet our customers' needs. By partnering with Google, we are able to offer a state-of-the-art smart home security solution that is both affordable and easy to use," said Clark. . The ADT Self Setup system is expected to be a popular choice for homeowners who want the peace of mind that comes with knowing that their homes and families are protected. With easy DIY installation, real-time alerts, and professional monitoring, the system offers a comprehensive and reliable security solution. . In conclusion, Google's partnership with ADT has finally produced a new home security product in the form of the ADT Self Setup system that is fully integrated with Nest devices. The system offers professional monitoring, real-time alerts, and a convenient mobile app that allows users to monitor and control their security system from anywhere. The system is easy to install and use, making it perfect for homeowners who want a reliable and convenient way to protect their homes. The introductory offer of $380 makes it a cost-effective solution as well.
