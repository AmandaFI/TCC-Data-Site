Amper, a Chicago-based company, is revolutionizing the manufacturing industry with its plug-and-play solution to digitize factories. Founded in 2016, the company initially set out to develop a smart circuit breaker for homes but soon realized the potential in the field of industrial manufacturing. Co-founder and CEO Akshat Thirani drew inspiration from his family's background in running factories in India and saw an opportunity to bring digital transformation to the manufacturing sector. Amper developed a plug and play system that can retrofit factory machines, making it easy to install and measure energy flow. The system takes approximately one week to calibrate and provides crucial information about the machine's status and output on a single dashboard. While the insights gathered may not be as extensive as those obtained from machines with built-in sensing capabilities, the tradeoff lies in its affordability and ease of installation. Recognizing the need for more funding to support its expansion plans, Amper announced that it has raised $11 million in Series A funding. The additional capital will be utilized to expand the team and further develop its product. Thirani has ambitious goals to make digitizing factories more accessible and consumer-friendly by eliminating the need for salespeople and consultants. Instead, Amper aims to enable manufacturers to purchase the products directly from their website. The traditional process of digitizing factories often involves engaging salespeople and consultants, making it a complex and costly affair. Amper's innovative approach seeks to simplify this process, allowing manufacturers to take control of their digitization efforts. By removing intermediaries and offering a direct purchasing option, Amper aims to democratize digital transformation in the manufacturing sector. One of the key advantages of Amper's plug-and-play solution is its ease of installation. Manufacturers can retrofit their existing machines without significant downtime or disruption to production. The system seamlessly integrates into the factory machines, capturing vital energy flow data and providing real-time insights. While the insights may not be as granular as those obtained from machines with built-in sensing capabilities, the affordability and simplicity of Amper's solution make it an attractive option for manufacturers seeking to embrace digital transformation without breaking the bank. The single dashboard interface provided by Amper's system enables manufacturers to monitor the status and performance of their machines in real-time. This visibility allows them to identify bottlenecks, optimize energy consumption, and ensure efficient production processes. With the $11 million in Series A funding, Amper plans to expand its team and invest in further product development. Thirani envisions a future where digitizing factories becomes the norm, accessible and consumer-friendly for manufacturers of all sizes. As Amper continues to refine its plug-and-play system, the manufacturing industry can look forward to a more streamlined and cost-effective approach to digital transformation. By empowering manufacturers to purchase directly from their website, Amper is breaking down barriers and putting the power of digitization in the hands of those who need it most. With its focus on affordability, ease of installation, and real-time insights, Amper is poised to revolutionize the manufacturing landscape. The company's pioneering approach to digitization has the potential to propel the industry into a new era, where factories of all sizes can harness the benefits of digital transformation.
