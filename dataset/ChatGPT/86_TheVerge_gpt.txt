Elon Musk's obsession with blue checks is a verified problem, according to critics who are slamming the billionaire for his recent Twitter dealings. Musk's acquisition of Twitter for $44 billion has been labeled as the "most time-adjusted value-destructive leveraged buyout of all time" by William Cohan, writing for Puck. Since the deal, Twitter's estimated value has plummeted by more than half and its actual worth is even lower than that. Banks holding $13 billion of Twitter's debt are unable to sell it for more than 50 cents on the dollar. Twitter's financial woes have been exacerbated by the release of its new paid subscription service called Twitter Blue, which costs $8 a month. This service is unlikely to appeal to verified users such as LeBron James and the White House who have stated that they will not pay for it. This lack of interest in the new subscription service is one of the key reasons why Twitter's revenue has fallen by half since October, despite ads being the primary source of revenue. Musk's involvement in Twitter has been harshly criticized, with some pointing out his apparent failure with advertisers. The fact that Twitter's revenue has continued to decline even after Musk took over the company has raised serious doubts about the billionaire's ability to turn things around. This is particularly damaging to Musk's reputation as a tech genius, which has been built up over many years. The fallout from Musk's social media troubles could also impact his other businesses, particularly Tesla, which is heavily reliant on social media for marketing and advertising. Musk's reputation as a visionary entrepreneur has been one of the key drivers behind Tesla's success, and any damage to his reputation could have an adverse effect on the company's sales and profits. Despite the many challenges facing Twitter, Musk continues to defend his decision to acquire the company. In a recent interview with CNBC, the billionaire argued that Twitter's potential for growth and profitability is still strong and that he remains committed to turning the company's fortunes around. However, many analysts and experts remain skeptical about Musk's ability to deliver on his promises. They argue that his track record with social media companies is not strong, and that his obsession with blue checks and other superficial metrics is not a sound basis for running a successful business. As Twitter continues to struggle, the pressure is mounting on Musk to find a way to turn things around. The billionaire's reputation is on the line, and his failure to deliver on his promises could have serious consequences for his various businesses. It remains to be seen whether he can rise to the challenge and find a way to make Twitter profitable once again.
