China's electric vehicles (EVs) are rapidly rising in popularity, and are now being exported to Europe, thus increasing competition for foreign automakers such as Buick, BMW, and Mercedes-Benz. With surging sales in China, the country is expected to push Japan out of the top position for global car export volume this year, adding to the challenges faced by foreign firms. While it is not yet expected that Chinese brands will make big plays for the US market, they are expected to create pressure in Europe. During the recently concluded Shanghai Auto Show, Warren Buffet-backed automaker BYD unveiled its Seagull EV, which is expected to become China's best-selling EV, with a starting price of CNY78,000 ($11,300). Industry watchers predict that China will dominate the EV market, and in doing so, Tesla could lose profit ground. According to a report by Bloomberg, China sold 1.3 million EVs last year, which is more than three times the sales figure in the US. Furthermore, the report predicts that China is expected to sell almost 1.5 million EVs this year, compared to the US's forecasted sales of 227,000 units. With such a massive increase in sales, it's not hard to see why foreign automakers are feeling the pressure. China's rise in the Electric Vehicle market is being attributed to the government's ambitious program to phase out gas-powered cars and switch to EVs. China's EV production companies have received generous subsidies from the government to promote the use and production of EVs. This has allowed Chinese firms such as BYD to offer cheaper EVs in the market, making EVs more accessible to the masses. While foreign automakers will face pressure from Chinese EVs on their home turf, the Chinese brands are expected to remain a rare occurrence on American roads. The US market is highly regulated, and the stringent safety regulations will be a significant obstacle for Chinese automakers in this market. However, China's goal of becoming the leader in EV production and sales has not been without challenges. One of the primary hurdles facing Chinese EV manufacturers is the inability to build quality EV batteries. The EV battery production and supply chain remains largely dominated by foreign companies such as LG Chem, Panasonic, and Tesla. Despite the challenges facing China's EV industry, it is clear that the country's EV market is rapidly growing, with predictions that it could become the world leader in EV sales. Such predictions raise serious questions about Tesla's profit margins, as the US automaker has been the leader in the global EV market for years. With BYD's Seagull EV seen as becoming China's best-selling EV, it is clear that Tesla's position as a market leader could be under threat. In addition to concerns about the rise of China's EV market, Lyft is prepping for deep cuts as it continues to struggle to control its expenses. According to sources familiar with the matter, Lyft is planning to lay off almost twenty percent of their workforce and furloughing many more due to the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on its operations. Lyft, which had recently announced that it was planning to cut $300 million in expenses this year, is now taking this to another level as it looks to reduce salaries across the board, including those of senior executives. The company's workforce reduction plan aims to lower the company's expenses and increase its cash reserves, with the goal of making the company profitable by 2021. Lyft's woes come after it recently reported disappointing Q1 earnings, missing both revenue and EPS estimates. The company pointed out that the COVID-19 pandemic had hurt its business, causing a decline of 75% in the number of rides it provided. With the pandemic still ongoing and countries increasingly focused on social distancing measures, it remains uncertain as to when businesses such as Lyft will see increased demand for services. As the world continues to adjust to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, businesses such as Lyft are forced to take drastic measures to cut costs and ensure their survival. The rise of China's EV market also presents new challenges for foreign automakers, highlighting the need for them to adapt and innovate to remain competitive.
