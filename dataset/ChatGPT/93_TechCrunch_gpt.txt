Investors are being urged to forget about banks and focus on the climate crisis instead, following last week's report from the U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The report highlighted that the world has already warmed by 1.1 degrees Celsius and is on a trajectory towards 1.5 degrees Celsius, the limit set by the Paris Agreement, by the early 2030s. Despite the urgent need for climate solutions like clean energy, fusion and carbon capture, these areas are currently chronically underinvested in, with only $40 billion put into clean energy last year compared to $122 billion into software-as-a-service by venture capitalists. Investment in climate tech needs to increase substantially to tackle the issue with potentially high returns.  . While investing in climate tech carries considerable risk, the potential upside could be transformational. The small investment of $1.1 billion globally in fusion energy is seen as a potential “get out of jail free” card. To counter financial failures from high-risk investments, venture capitalists would need to take 100 times more bets or massively increase the size of the funds meant for the adoption of promising technologies. Climate tech investment has the potential to return to its origins and have an impact that goes beyond monetary gains: change the world.  . The report from the U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change confirms the grave threat facing the planet. With global temperatures increasing at an astonishing rate, the world is already experiencing the effects of climate change, such as rising sea levels, extreme weather conditions, and the loss of biodiversity. There is a pressing need for greater investment in climate solutions to help tackle this issue. Despite the urgency, some are still reluctant to invest in clean energy, fusion and carbon capture, focusing instead on other areas they perceive as being more lucrative, such as technology and finance.  . Venture capitalists invested $122 billion globally in software-as-a-service last year, while only $40 billion was invested in clean energy. However, investing in climate tech has the potential to generate substantial returns, with fusion energy viewed as a game-changer. While $1.1 billion has been invested globally in fusion energy, it could well be the "get out of jail free" card that the planet desperately needs. Such high-risk investments may fail, but investors need to take more significant risks to tackle climate change and potentially reap huge returns in the future.  . But to counter failures from betting on risky but promising technologies, investors would need to place 100 times more bets or significantly increase the size of their funds. Investing in climate tech is not just about monetary gains. It has the potential to change the world and make a real difference, beyond profit margins. Climate tech investment can return to its roots and become about facilitating change, and truly revolutionizing markets to a sustainable future.  . Climate change poses a long-term threat to the planet and demands urgent action. The U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's recent report highlighted the dire consequences if meaningful action is not taken to reduce carbon emissions. Such action could take many forms, such as investing in clean energy, fusion, and carbon capture, as well as divesting from dirty energy and supporting renewables. There is also a need for structural change in the way that environmentally sustainable initiatives are funded, moving beyond the current focus on profit margins.  . Investing in climate tech carries a degree of risk, but the potential rewards are enormous. With only a small investment of $1.1 billion globally in fusion energy, there is a potential "get out of jail free" card that carries enormous benefits for the planet. To counter financial failures from high-risk investments, venture capitalists would need to take 100 times more bets or massively increase the size of their funds to enable significant investment in these nascent technologies.  . Investors need to seize this critical moment and recognize the transformative potential of risky, but promising climate tech. Investment in climate tech has the potential to return to its roots by changing the world, not just for the prospect of material gain. It's time to move beyond short-term thinking, focus on addressing one of the greatest challenges facing humanity, and create a sustainable future for future generations.
