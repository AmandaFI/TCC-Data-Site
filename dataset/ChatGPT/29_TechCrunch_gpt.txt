Actresses and entrepreneurs Erin and Sara Foster have launched a new venture capital firm, Oversubscribed Ventures, with a focus on investing in early-stage consumer technology and supporting tech brands. The sisters, who are also the co-founders of the popular clothing line Favorite Daughter, will run the fund alongside Phil Schwarz, a partner at Corazon Capital. Oversubscribed Ventures has already invested in six companies, including NFT marketplace OpenSea and skincare startup Exponent. The firm plans to expand its portfolio throughout 2023, and is actively seeking out new investment opportunities in the consumer tech space. Erin and Sara Foster are well-known in the entertainment industry, with extensive credits as writers, producers, and performers. However, they are no strangers to the world of business and entrepreneurship, having launched Favorite Daughter in 2019 and grown it into a successful brand in its own right. Now, with Oversubscribed Ventures, the sisters are looking to use their experience and expertise to help support and grow emerging tech companies. "We're excited to be launching Oversubscribed Ventures and to be investing in some of the most innovative and disruptive companies in the consumer tech space," said Erin Foster. "We're looking to back brands that are changing the game in areas like e-commerce, health and wellness, and sustainable consumer products, among others.". The Fosters are part of a growing trend of celebrity entrepreneurs launching venture capital firms and investing in tech startups. Other notable examples include Ashton Kutcher's Sound Ventures, which has invested in companies like Airbnb, Uber, and Spotify, and Will Smith's Dreamers VC, which has backed startups like telemedicine platform Edison Health and cybersecurity firm Aura. However, Oversubscribed Ventures is unique in its focus on consumer tech and its commitment to supporting emerging brands. "We believe that the consumer tech space is ripe for disruption and innovation, and we're thrilled to be backing some of the most exciting companies in the space today," said Sara Foster. "We're also committed to providing our portfolio companies with the resources and support they need to grow and succeed.". Phil Schwarz, who brings extensive experience in the world of venture capital to the team, echoed this sentiment. "We're looking to build strong and lasting relationships with the companies we invest in, and to provide them with the strategic guidance and support they need to achieve their goals," he said. "We believe that the consumer tech space is a dynamic and rapidly evolving landscape, and we're excited to be a part of it.". Oversubscribed Ventures is part of a new wave of emerging fund managers who are launching venture capital firms and raising their first funds. Other notable examples include Phenomenal Ventures, founded by Meena Harris, which focuses on investing in diverse, mission-driven companies, and Ovni Capital, which was launched by Natalie Portman and other female investors and supports startups in the media and entertainment space. With Oversubscribed Ventures, Erin and Sara Foster are poised to make a significant impact in the consumer tech space, and to help shape the future of the industry. As they continue to grow their portfolio and support emerging brands, they are sure to become a force to be reckoned with in the world of venture capital.
