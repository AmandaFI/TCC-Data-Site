TechCrunch+, a media outlet focused on the tech industry, has launched a new series that provides insight into the financial side of building new technology companies. "Rounds that Matter" will focus on recent notable venture capital investments, exit activity and other news related to tech startups. Despite a slowdown in venture capital activity caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant amount of money is being invested in tech startups. Banks, however, are dealing with the failure of Silicon Valley Bank. Startup tech companies are still able to raise capital, but an inactive IPO market has seen more former exits than the latter. Investors are eagerly awaiting a reawakening of this key exit point for startups. Until then, there's still interest in tracking where and how money is flowing into the startup world. TechCrunch+ hopes to provide insight into how fintech fortunes are affected by the pandemic and unforeseen circumstances and whether Asia's reseller revival will impact this sector.
