Energy Supplier Counts Cost of Devices on Standby. New research conducted by British Gas has revealed that UK households can save an average of £147 per year by simply turning off electronic appliances that continue to drain power even when on standby. These devices, often referred to as "vampire devices," can significantly contribute to higher energy bills if left plugged in. The Energy Saving Trust (EST) has advised consumers to be more mindful of the devices they leave switched on in order to save approximately £55 per year. However, the EST did not provide specific details on how it arrived at this figure, acknowledging that appliance-related statistics and prices can vary depending on factors such as model, functionality, and individual usage. Brian Horn, Senior Insight and Analytics Consultant at the EST, suggested practical solutions for consumers, such as switching off devices at the wall or unplugging them when not in use. He also recommended ensuring easy accessibility to plugs for easy switching off or using extension leads to consolidate multiple plugs. The recent 54% rise in the energy price cap has resulted in a typical household paying £1,971 per year for gas and electricity. Dhara Vyas, deputy director of Energy UK, warned that bills could increase even further, potentially reaching £3,000 this winter. Leaving devices plugged into the wall continues to draw power, contributing to these higher bills. British Gas conducted calculations on the costs of devices left on standby using average wattage costs from different manufacturers' standard models. For example, a television left on standby can cost £24.61 per year, while a set-top box from companies like Sky or Virgin Media can incur £23.10. Games consoles left on standby average at £12.17 per year, and computers can cost around £11.22. However, these figures are based on research on only 13 standard appliances, while the average household has 41 electrical appliances. This suggests that the actual costs of vampire devices could be higher than estimated. The EST estimates that between 9% and 16% of electricity consumed in homes is used by such devices. Therefore, the potential savings by turning them off could be even more significant. In terms of overall energy efficiency, newer devices tend to be more energy-efficient compared to older ones. This is because newer TVs are required to comply with EU energy efficiency standards. Marc Robson, a British Gas energy expert, suggests using extension leads or smart plugs that allow devices to be turned off remotely with a phone. This way, consumers can easily control energy usage and reduce their bills. The impact of "vampire devices" on energy bills is often overlooked, but with rising energy prices, it is crucial for households to take action. Simple steps like turning off devices at the wall or unplugging them when not in use can result in significant savings. Being mindful of the number of appliances left on standby and investing in energy-efficient devices can also help reduce energy consumption and lower bills. Consumers are urged to consider the advice from the EST and take action to minimize their energy usage. With the potential to save up to £147 per year, it's an opportunity for households to take control of their energy consumption and contribute to a more sustainable future.
