Climate tech startups in Africa are on track to receive significant venture capital funding, with equity investments in clean energy technologies driving the majority of activity. Despite macroeconomic headwinds, these startups secured more than $860m in equity last year - a 3.5 times increase - making climate tech the second most funded sector after fintech. Investors are increasingly interested in backing innovative start-ups in the rapidly growing African climate technology space, with a series of new funds raised specifically to invest in this burgeoning market. One such fund is the Novastar venture capital fund, which is reportedly seeking to raise over $200m for its latest investment vehicle. Another firm, Equator, has announced the initial close of its new fund, aimed at backing startups in the energy, agriculture, and mobility sectors, all of which are experiencing strong growth in Africa as the continent transitions to a more sustainable future. Cleantech startups have long faced obstacles in securing funding, particularly in less developed markets such as Africa. However, the recent wave of investor interest in climate tech represents a tipping point for Africa-based startups, who are well placed to leverage their local knowledge and innovative solutions to address unique challenges in the African market. According to reports, beyond traditional VCs, climate tech startups have also been attracting interest from corporate investors such as energy companies and wealthy philanthropists. These groups are recognising that cleantech and sustainability-focused technologies in African markets not only have the potential to be profitable, but can also bring vital socio-economic benefits, such as mitigating the impacts of the climate crisis and supporting sustainable development. One notable example of this trend is M-Kopa, a Kenyan-based startup that uses mobile payments and solar power to provide affordable energy to customers who may not have access to grid electricity. The company has secured $170m from investors including Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg, and is now delivering power to over one million homes and businesses across East Africa. As demand for clean energy, sustainable agriculture, and smart mobility solutions continues to grow in Africa, so too will opportunities for climate tech startups to make an impact. In the wake of Covid-19, in particular, many investors are looking to support businesses that are offering innovative solutions to the challenges facing society and the environment in the long-term. With the significant funding opportunities that are now opening up, African climate tech startups will be well placed to seize these opportunities and build a more sustainable future for all.
