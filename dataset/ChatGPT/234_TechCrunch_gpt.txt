Who really benefits from digital development? In the age of rapid technological advancement, digital development initiatives have become a popular tool in the international development sector. These initiatives aim to provide digital products and services to lift people out of poverty. While they are often seen as beneficial, a recent article argues that their costs and negative impacts are often ignored, raising the question: who really benefits from digital development? One major concern highlighted in the article is the issue of data and privacy. In today's world, data has become the most valuable commodity, and the 3 billion people who are not yet connected to the internet represent a vast source of untapped data. When Western development actors connect these people to digital services, they also put their privacy and data at the mercy of tech companies looking to monetize them. This creates a contradiction in digital development, as initiatives aimed at reducing poverty also enrich tech companies and enable them to profit from marginalized populations' data. The article goes on to address specific examples of digital development initiatives that have significant drawbacks. One example is the use of microloans, which are often disbursed through mobile money accounts. Microloans have been touted as an effective method of providing capital to those in poverty, but evidence has shown that they do not actually reduce poverty. In fact, microloans can lead to increased indebtedness and even cause people to lose their land. Despite this, digital financial services, including microloans, continue to thrive because they generate fees and valuable data. Another example discussed is India's digital identity system, Aadhaar, which assigns individuals a unique digital identity through their fingerprints and eye scans. Aadhaar has been lauded as a means of connecting people to government services, but it has excluded millions of people from accessing those services. The system's databases have flaws, leading to authentication errors and denying individuals their benefits. Additionally, Aadhaar generates valuable data for tech companies, allowing them to track individuals' financial activity and sell the data to third parties for targeted ads or eligibility screening for loans and insurance. The lack of data protection and privacy laws in many poor countries further exacerbates the risks associated with digital development initiatives. Multinational corporations have an advantage in countries without adequate protections for local firms, and Big Tech has actively lobbied against stronger data protection laws to maintain their dominance. This leaves users of digital development programs vulnerable to surveillance and data extraction. The article concludes by asserting that digital services alone will not solve global poverty and calls for a more direct approach. It argues that the redistribution of technology companies' profits could provide the necessary funds to eradicate poverty. Instead of magnifying tech companies' earnings, digital development practitioners should advocate for redistributing those earnings to address the root causes of poverty. The drawbacks and potential harms of digital development initiatives in the international development sector have been brought into focus in a recent article. While these initiatives aim to provide digital products and services to lift people out of poverty, their costs and negative impacts are often overlooked. One major concern raised in the article is the issue of data and privacy. The world's most valuable commodity is data, and the 3 billion people who are not yet connected to the internet represent a vast source of untapped data.
