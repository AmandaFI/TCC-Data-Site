Robotics safety firm, Veo Robotics, has announced the closure of a $29m series B funding round. The Massachusetts-based company’s proprietary software solutions have been designed to support collaboration between humans and robots. Amazon’s Industrial Innovation Fund played a crucial role in Veo’s latest funding round. The capital secured by Veo Robotics will be used to accelerate the company’s partnerships with corporate partners to enable safer and more efficient productivity. The newly secured funds will also allow Veo Robotics to expand its platform services. The Industrial Innovation Fund, managed by global e-commerce giant Amazon, invests in technology companies specialising in robotics. Although Amazon’s Kiva robots operate in a confined space, the Proteus, an autonomous device allowing for closer collaboration between humans and robots, is part of its latest innovation offerings. The latest funding by Amazon brings Veo Robotics’ total investments to over $63m. For Clara Vu, Co-Founder and CTO of Veo Robotics, the partnership with Amazon enhances the Silicon Valley start-up’s position as a driver for the future of safety application developments. Concerns around workplace safety pose a challenge to the deployment of robots in many industries. Fatalities arising from poor safety protocols have occurred. In one case, a Virginia-based employee working for robotics manufacturing firm, PaR Systems, was crushed to death by a 15-ton robotic arm. The rise of collaborative robots, known as “cobots”, and the increased adoption of AI technology have increased the need for specialised safety measures, such as the ones provided by Veo Robotics. This trend is proliferating in car manufacturing. A low safety rating recently impacted the efficacy and use of the Nissan NV200 van, in which production line workers had to enter the vehicle to carry out crucial tasks, such as attaching bolts to seat frames. However, Veo Robotics’ technology can render such interventions unnecessary by enhancing robot ‘vision’ to detect human movement and adjusting its actions and movement to ensure workers are not endangered. The pressure for increased productivity, to meet rising consumer demands, and to keep pace with a rapidly changing landscape, highlights the need for greater collaboration between humans and machines. However, significant safety and productivity boosts must occur alongside automation. Examples of this progression include the world’s first autonomous oil rig, recently deployed by Aker BP, which will use robotic systems and AI software to monitor operational performance. Nils Andreas Masvie, Director of Technology at Aker BP, highlights the impact of the robots: “The integration of more technology, including robotics, has been important to develop a safe, efficient and sustainable production system.”. The need for safety systems that can be relied upon to prevent industrial accidents remains a prominent deterrent to widespread adoption of autonomous machines. For this reason, robotics safety firms, including Veo Robotics, remain integral partners in enabling such progress. Co-founder and CEO of Veo Robotics, Patrick Sobalvarro, is excited by the potential of partnerships with industry working: “It is in joint deployments with visionary industrial companies that Veo’s technology reaches its full potential,” he said. Through Veo’s technology, workers’ livelihoods can be safeguarded, without constraining production lines and manufacturing processes. Adoption of Veo Robotics’ solutions, which leverage technology including 3D cameras, LiDAR systems, microphones, and various sensors, will help to eliminate the risks of potential accidents and enhance productivity in otherwise inefficient manufacturing processes.
