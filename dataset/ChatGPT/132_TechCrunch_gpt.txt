Haltian, a Finnish startup that specializes in equipping office buildings with smart sensors, announced that they have successfully raised €22m in a funding round led by Mandatum Asset Management Growth Equity. Other investors include Varma, Tesi, Ventic and Inventure. The company offers a suite of sensors, cellular gateways, device management dashboards and software to help companies orchestrate IoT in the workplace. Their products can count the number of people in an office or building, track CO2 and humidity levels, monitor for light usage, leaks and dips in temperature and even detect when paper, towel and soap dispensers are running low. Haltian explained that the funds raised will support international expansion in Central Europe and North America, as well as recruitment efforts. The company is hopeful that these new funds will help them achieve their vision of a fully connected workplace - one where sensors can help improve the work environment, increase productivity and reduce costs. The office space has been undergoing a transformation in recent years, with the rise of co-working spaces and the adoption of new technologies. Haltian’s smart sensors are just one of the many new technologies that are changing the way we think about work. With their products, companies can better understand how their employees use their facilities, which can help them make smarter decisions about everything from energy consumption to office layout. Smart sensors can play a powerful role in the workplace by detecting when spaces are underutilized or overoccupied. For example, if sensors detect that a conference room is consistently underutilized, a company might convert it into a different type of space, such as a break room or a quiet work area. Similarly, sensors can help companies reduce their energy consumption by detecting when offices are empty and automatically adjusting heating, cooling, and lighting accordingly. This not only reduces energy consumption but also helps companies save money on their energy bills. Another benefit of smart sensors is that they can help create a healthier work environment. By monitoring CO2 levels, humidity, and temperature, companies can ensure that their workspaces are comfortable and healthy for their employees. High levels of CO2, for example, can lead to headaches, while low humidity levels can cause dry skin and nasal passages. Haltian’s suite of sensors also includes a range of environmental sensors that can detect things like water leaks and dips in temperature. This can help companies prevent costly damage from water leaks and ensure that their equipment is kept at the optimal temperature. Finally, Haltian’s products can help companies reduce waste by monitoring the usage of paper towels, soap dispensers, and other consumables. By monitoring these usage rates, companies can ensure that they only order supplies when they are needed, rather than keeping excess inventory on hand. Overall, Haltian’s smart sensors offer a range of benefits to companies looking to improve their work environment, reduce costs, and increase productivity. With their new funds, the company is poised to expand their reach and bring their technology to even more businesses around the world.
