Zhao Weiguo: Chinese regulator accuses chip tycoon of corruption. Zhao Weiguo, the former chairman of computer chipmaker Tsinghua Unigroup, has been accused of corruption by China's anti-fraud watchdog, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection. According to the regulator, Mr. Zhao "took the state-owned company he managed as his private fiefdom," by handing profitable businesses to relatives and friends and purchasing goods and services from companies managed by associates at "prices significantly higher than the market.". Zhao's case has been handed over to prosecutors, who are expected to file charges against him soon. The accusations come as the Chinese government increases scrutiny of its semiconductor industry, a strategically important sector for the country's technological development. They also follow financial troubles at Tsinghua Unigroup, which defaulted on several bond payments in 2020. Mr Zhao's alleged misconduct occurred while he was at the helm of Tsinghua Unigroup, which he joined in 2015. During his tenure, the company invested heavily in the semiconductor industry, acquiring majority stakes in a number of leading chipmakers, including Spreadtrum Communications and RDA Microelectronics. However, despite these efforts, Tsinghua Unigroup struggled to make a profit, and in 2020, it defaulted on bond payments worth around CNY 4 billion ($640 million). Following the default, Tsinghua Unigroup underwent a significant restructuring, which placed it under the control of a consortium led by two state-backed venture capital firms. At the time, analysts suggested that the move was part of a broader effort by Chinese authorities to reduce the influence of private companies and promote state-owned enterprises in the critical semiconductor industry. Zhao's case is the latest in a series of corruption investigations that have targeted high-profile figures in China's tech sector. In recent years, regulators have handed down harsh punishments to companies and executives accused of wrongdoing, including fines, prison sentences, and even death penalties. The increased pressure on the tech industry comes amid growing tensions between China and the United States, which have increasingly used trade restrictions to target Chinese companies, particularly in the semiconductor sector. This has led to a renewed focus on developing China's own semiconductor capabilities and reducing its reliance on foreign technology. Despite the challenges facing the sector, China's government remains committed to its goal of becoming a global leader in the semiconductor industry. In March, the Chinese government announced plans to invest billions of dollars in new semiconductor projects, including the construction of a $28 billion chip plant in the city of Wuhan. Whether these efforts will bear fruit remains to be seen, however, as Chinese companies continue to face significant hurdles, including fierce competition, limited access to key technologies, and pressure from foreign governments. For Mr. Zhao, however, the stakes are much more personal, as he now faces the prospect of criminal charges and potentially severe consequences for his alleged misconduct at Tsinghua Unigroup.
