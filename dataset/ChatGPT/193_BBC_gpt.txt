Filter out 'unverified' accounts, tech giants told. The UK government has proposed that social media platforms should give users the option to hide posts and messages from accounts without verified owners. This suggestion is part of the government's online safety bill, which aims to tackle anonymous trolling. If the bill is passed, major social networks like Facebook may be obligated to implement filters for unverified accounts. It is also stated in the bill that social networks could be fined up to 10% of their global turnover if they fail to address harmful content. The legislation encompasses a range of issues, including revenge porn, human trafficking, online extremism, and the promotion of suicide. It points to the racist abuse faced by England's football players during Euro 2020 as an example of the kind of online trolling it seeks to combat. While the proposed law would not prevent individuals from creating anonymous accounts and posting abusive content, social media platforms would need to provide users with the option to "opt out" of seeing posts from unverified accounts. The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) has suggested potential methods of user verification, such as matching profile photos, submitting government identification, or linking accounts to registered mobile phone numbers. The specific verification process would ultimately be determined by the social networks themselves. Although the DCMS acknowledges the various purposes anonymous accounts serve, such as whistleblowing and self-expression in oppressive environments, it emphasizes the importance of empowering users with tools to control who can interact with them. The bill would also require social media platforms to enable users to filter out "legal but harmful" content, including the promotion of eating disorders and dangerous vaccine disinformation. Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries has expressed optimism regarding the proposed law, asserting that individuals would have a greater degree of control over their online interactions and be able to combat hate speech fueled by algorithmic recommendations. This development comes as governments worldwide are grappling with the challenges posed by harmful online content. The United Kingdom's proposed legislation reflects an effort to strike a balance between protecting individuals from abuse while also preserving the ability to engage in anonymous online activities that serve important purposes. As the bill moves forward, tech giants will likely face increased pressure to take responsibility for the content shared on their platforms and provide users with greater control over their online experience.
