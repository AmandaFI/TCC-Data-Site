China is pushing for homegrown artificial intelligence (AI) to reflect the country’s core values of socialism, with draft guidelines released for regulating generative AI. The guidelines were announced by the Cyberspace Administration of China and aim to ensure that generative AI does not threaten national unity or attempt to overthrow the state. Additionally, the technology must not be used to distribute false information or content that could disrupt social and economic order, or promote terrorism, extremism or ethnic hatred. Cybersecurity experts predict that the new guidelines will impact Chinese firms such as Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent, as they develop more homegrown alternatives to Western AI companies. The new guidelines are part of China’s efforts to regulate the nascent AI industry, as the country seeks to become a world leader in AI technology. China has already made strides in the field, with Chinese companies such as Huawei and iFlytek developing AI systems that perform tasks such as speech recognition and language translation. However, the government has been concerned about the potential dangers of AI, particularly the ability of AI technology to perpetuate false information and harm national security. The guidelines for regulating generative AI aim to prevent the misuse of the technology, with the stipulation that AI should be designed to prevent discrimination. The guidelines also call for security reviews of generative AI services, as well as ensuring that the technology does not undermine national unity or overthrow the state. This could potentially disrupt the development of AI in China, as companies may need to modify their products to comply with the guidelines. The guidelines also come as Chinese firms seek to develop homegrown alternatives to Western AI systems. Recently, Chinese search engine Baidu launched its own AI generative model, called ERNIE (Enhanced Representation through kNowledge IntEgration). Baidu has stated that ERNIE is designed to better understand Chinese languages and culture, with the added benefit of being more secure and less biased than Western alternatives. However, some have expressed concern that the new guidelines could hinder the growth of China’s AI industry, as it may limit the potential uses of AI. Some experts have also suggested that the guidelines could lead to further censorship and the suppression of dissent. Despite these concerns, the Chinese government remains committed to developing AI technology, with plans to invest billions in research and development. The country has already set up a national laboratory for AI, with the aim of developing AI systems for a range of applications, such as healthcare and transportation. In conclusion, the new guidelines for regulating generative AI in China are part of the government’s efforts to ensure that the country’s AI technology reflects its core values of socialism and does not threaten national unity or security. While the guidelines may lead to some disruption in the development of AI in China, they also aim to prevent the misuse of AI and promote the use of more secure and less biased technologies. The impact of the guidelines on China’s AI industry remains to be seen, but the country’s commitment to investing in research and development suggests that the industry will continue to grow in the coming years.
