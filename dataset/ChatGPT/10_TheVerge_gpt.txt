Why this new plant is capturing carbon dioxide just to let it back out again. Global Thermostat, a US company specializing in direct air capture (DAC) technology, is hoping to revolutionize the fight against climate change by opening a demonstration plant in Colorado to test its ability to lower atmospheric carbon dioxide levels. Unlike its competitors, Global Thermostat plans to sell its technology for other companies to use, rather than building large facilities itself, and is following a strategy similar to that of solar panel manufacturers. The company's DAC technology essentially captures carbon dioxide directly from the air, with the aim of lowering levels in the atmosphere. However, critics have expressed doubts over the efficacy of such a method, arguing that capturing CO2 does not reduce greenhouse gas pollution, and warning that it could be a poor substitute for reducing pollution at source through the transition to renewable energy. Despite these concerns, Global Thermostat remains upbeat about its new technology. Speaking to journalists at the opening of the demonstration plant, CEO Graciela Chichilnisky argued that DAC has the potential to "reverse the damage caused by industrial activity". She explained that the captured carbon dioxide can be sold to other companies or used in a variety of industrial processes, such as enhanced oil recovery. Critics have countered, however, that such methods simply allow companies to continue polluting without actually reducing their carbon footprint. Mark Hertsgaard, writing for The Guardian, argues that "if we want to save the planet from climate change, getting the carbon out of the air isn't enough - we have to stop putting it there in the first place". It remains to be seen whether Global Thermostat's strategy will be successful in drawing wider interest in DAC technology. The demonstration plant will operate for up to two years, during which time the company will be monitoring and optimizing its carbon capture process. If successful, the company plans to roll out its technology globally, in the hope of reducing atmospheric carbon dioxide levels and combating climate change.
