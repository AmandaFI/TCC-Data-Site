Apple’s upcoming iPhone 15 Pro models may include physical buttons instead of the previously rumoured solid-state buttons, according to reliable Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. Kuo revealed that Apple will not be replacing the physical volume and power buttons with solid-state options, despite previous speculation that the technology would be similar to the iPhone 8’s home button with haptic feedback. Another analyst, Jeff Pu of Haitong Tech, also believes that Apple will stick with mechanical buttons. While it is unclear what technical issues have led to Apple’s decision to avoid solid-state button technology, Kuo has said that the change will not affect Apple’s production schedule. This updated information will come as a disappointment to solid-state button hardware suppliers that were hoping to see a significant increase in demand for their products. Solid-state buttons are often preferred by smartphone manufacturers for their durability and waterproofing abilities. However, Apple’s decision to retain physical buttons may not have a significant impact on the overall performance of the iPhone 15 Pro. The physical buttons have established themselves as reliable options that customers are familiar with, and have been used on smartphone models for years. As the hype around the iPhone 15 Pro builds, more information will undoubtedly be released about the device’s features and specifications. While the choice of physical buttons over solid-state buttons may not be the change some were hoping for, consumers will ultimately judge the device on its overall performance and capabilities. As one of the most highly anticipated smartphone releases of the year, the iPhone 15 Pro is sure to generate interest and speculation until its official release in the coming months.
