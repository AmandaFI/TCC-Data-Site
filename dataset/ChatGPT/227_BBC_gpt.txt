5G phones: How serious is the threat to US flights? US mobile networks AT&T and Verizon have agreed to delay the expansion of their 5G service at some airports after concerns were raised by ten leading US airlines. The airlines warned that the new technology could cause flight delays. 5G is the next generation of mobile internet connection that allows for faster data download and upload speeds and enables more devices to access the internet simultaneously. It relies on the use of radio signals, and the frequencies used for 5G in the US, known as C-Band, are close to those used by radio altimeters on airplanes. Radio altimeters measure the height of the aircraft above the ground and provide data for safety and navigation systems. The concern is that interference from 5G transmissions could disrupt these instruments and pose safety risks, especially during aircraft landings. The risk to planes is potentially serious, as there have been warnings of "catastrophic failures leading to multiple fatalities" and 5G interference causing problems with various systems on Boeing's 787 Dreamliner. To maintain safety, planes will not be allowed to use radio altimeters in circumstances where there is a risk of interference. However, this could limit aircraft landing capabilities, particularly in poor visibility conditions, leading to flight delays and cancellations. Airlines for America, which represents ten major carriers, has estimated that more than 1,000 flights could be affected in bad weather, potentially grounding a significant portion of the US aircraft fleet. Other countries using 5G, such as those in the EU, have implemented lower frequencies and power levels to reduce the risk of interference and have taken additional steps like creating buffer zones around airports. In response, US regulators have established temporary buffer zones around 50 airports, but these are smaller than those in France, and US transmitters will operate at higher power levels. They have also started identifying altimeters that can be used safely in areas with 5G and airports where GPS systems can guide approaching aircraft instead of radio altimeters. Verizon and AT&T have agreed to temporarily delay the expansion of 5G at some airport locations and switch off certain 5G masts while discussions continue to find a permanent solution. This is intended to reduce the possibility of interference with onboard systems. President Biden stated that the delay would only affect 10% of the masts involved in the 5G expansion. The 5G firms had already postponed the rollout twice and agreed to the temporary buffer zones. However, they expressed frustration at the latest delay, highlighting that 5G has been implemented in 40 countries and claiming that regulators had ample time to plan for its start. In the UK, regulators and airlines appear less concerned about the issue. The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) stated that there have been no confirmed instances of 5G interference causing aircraft system malfunctions or unexpected behavior. The UK regulator plans to collaborate internationally to gather further data on the matter. These concerns surrounding 5G and aviation safety have been ongoing for several months. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) have been working together to assess the potential risks and determine appropriate measures to ensure the safe coexistence of 5G and aviation systems. However, the implementation of 5G in the US has faced criticism from some aviation industry experts. David Silver, a former FAA chief scientist, expressed his concerns, stating that he believes the risk to aviation safety is real. He emphasized the need for comprehensive testing and analysis to understand the potential impact of 5G on critical aircraft systems. Silver also called for better communication and collaboration between the telecom industry and the aviation industry to address these concerns effectively. The 5G industry, on the other hand, argues that the US has taken a more cautious approach than other countries and that the technology has been successfully deployed in various locations worldwide. They claim that there are technical solutions available to mitigate any potential interference and that the temporary delays are unnecessary. As discussions between the telecom industry, airlines, and regulators continue, the focus remains on finding a viable solution that ensures the safety of aviation systems while allowing for the expansion of 5G. It is clear that this issue has significant implications for both the telecommunications and aviation industries, as well as for the millions of passengers who rely on air travel.
