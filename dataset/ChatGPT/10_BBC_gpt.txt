The women who left their jobs to code. Despite the fact that studies continue to show that women are less likely to pursue careers in STEM fields, more and more women in the UK are defying stereotypes by taking up coding and technology jobs. Encouraged by initiatives such as Code First Girls, women are starting to take up coding in greater numbers. According to the Office for National Statistics, the number of women working as programmers and software developers increased by 15,000 in 2021, with a further 10,000 becoming web designers. However, women still only make up 25% of coding jobs. One woman who left her job to pursue a career in coding is Amal Lawson, 28-year-old from London. Amal previously worked in marketing but became intrigued by the world of coding and technology. She signed up for a coding course with Code First Girls and after completing the course, secured a job as a software developer. "I always thought that coding and technology was a male-dominated industry and that it wasn't for me," Amal said. "But after taking the course with Code First Girls, I realized that women can also excel in this field. I'm really enjoying my new career and I'm excited to see where it takes me.". Code First Girls is a social enterprise that provides free coding courses to women and helps companies connect with newly trained female developers. Since its inception in 2012, the organization has trained over 20,000 women across the UK. "We believe that everyone should have the opportunity to learn how to code, regardless of their background," said Laura Stebbing, CEO of Code First Girls. "We are seeing more and more women taking up coding and we are proud to be a part of this change. Coding is a valuable skill that can lead to many exciting career opportunities.". Another woman who left her job to pursue a career in coding is Sarah Brown, 30-year-old from Manchester. Sarah worked in finance for several years but became frustrated with her job and wanted to do something more creative. She enrolled in a coding course with CodeClan, a digital skills academy in Manchester, and after completing the course, secured a job as a web developer. "I always loved technology but I never thought I could make a career out of it," Sarah said. "But after taking the course with CodeClan, I discovered a real passion for coding. It's so satisfying to build something from scratch and see it come to life. I'm so glad I made the leap and pursued a career in coding.". CodeClan is a digital skills academy that offers immersive coding courses for people looking to start a new career in the tech industry. Founded in Scotland in 2015, the organization has since expanded to Manchester and is helping to train the next generation of tech talent. "Technology is changing the world we live in and it's important that everyone has the skills they need to thrive," said Melinda Matthews, CEO of CodeClan. "We are seeing more and more women taking up coding and it's great to see. It's important that we continue to support women and encourage them to pursue careers in the tech industry.". The UK has a growing digital economy, with technology and digital sectors now accounting for almost 10% of the country's workforce. As the world becomes increasingly digital, it's important that all members of society have the skills they need to succeed in the 21st century. While there is still much work to be done to close the gender gap in coding and technology jobs, initiatives such as Code First Girls and CodeClan are helping to make a difference and encourage more women to pursue careers in these fields. As more and more women enter the world of coding and technology, there is hope that the industry will become more diverse, inclusive, and representative of society as a whole. With the right support and training, there's no reason why women can't excel in the world of coding and technology just as much as men.
