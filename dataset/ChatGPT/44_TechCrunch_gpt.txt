Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) is seeing a wave of departures, including its new Chief Risk Officer, Kim Olson, who is leaving the company after only three months on the job. At least one other executive is also leaving along with SVB's Chief Audit Executive. These departures come just two weeks after the bank sold a $72 billion chunk to First Citizens Bank. SVB is a financial institution focused on serving technology and life sciences startups and growth companies. It has provided financing and banking services to some of the most innovative companies of today, including Twitter, Uber, and Airbnb. But with the acquisition of a substantial part of the bank by First Citizens Bank, SVB has undergone some changes in its leadership. As part of its transition to new ownership, HSBC USA has hired 40 bankers from SVB to build a new offering dedicated to the innovation economy. The bank is bringing on experienced bankers to help focus on the specific needs of the technology and life sciences sectors. This move is part of HSBC's push to expand its presence in the US market. Meanwhile, the departure of SVB's Chief Risk Officer is raising eyebrows as she had only been on the job for a few months. Kim Olson joined SVB in June 2021 and was tasked with overseeing the bank's enterprise risk management function. According to sources, Olson's departure was unexpected and has left many wondering about the future of SVB's risk management strategy. SVB has not commented on the reasons behind Olson's departure or that of the other executives. It is unclear whether their departures were related to the recent acquisition or if they are the result of other internal issues. However, sources say that SVB is in the process of finding replacements for the departed executives. Kim Olson has had extensive experience in risk management, having held senior positions at various financial institutions, including GE Capital and Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ. Her departure from SVB is seen as a loss to the bank, particularly given the importance of risk management in the financial services industry. With the departure of key executives, SVB will undoubtedly face some challenges in the coming months. However, the bank has a long history of serving the innovation economy and is expected to continue to do so under its new ownership. As for HSBC USA, the new hires indicate the bank's commitment to expanding its offerings to the technology and life sciences sectors, two areas where it sees significant growth potential.
