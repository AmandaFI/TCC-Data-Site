Halcyon, a cybersecurity start-up based in California, has secured a large investment of $44m in a Series A funding round. The investment was led by SYN Ventures and Corner Ventures, with additional funding from Dell Technologies Capital. Halcyon intends to use the funds to further develop its engineering and R&D departments and increase its sales and marketing efforts. The start-up utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) to identify malicious intent and combat ransomware attacks. According to a report from SonicWall, ransomware attacks increased by 40% in 2020. Halcyon, which has attracted a total of $50m in funding since 2020, aims to address this problem by offering a solution that can recognize and prevent ransomware attacks before they occur. The company plans to expand its workforce from 75 to approximately 100 by the end of the year to further develop its technology. Halcyon's current customer base consists of 51 clients, and the company aims to expand its market reach by launching a data exfiltration tool to counter the increasingly popular "double extortion" techniques commonly used by ransomware groups. Halcyon also plans to offer support for additional operating systems, including Linux and Mac. The "double extortion" technique, which involves threatening not only to encrypt files but also to release sensitive information to the public if a ransom is not paid, has skyrocketed in popularity among ransomware groups. Halcyon's new data exfiltration tool aims to prevent this from happening by detecting and blocking attempts to transfer files out of a protected network. Ransomware attacks often target small and medium-sized businesses, which may not have the resources to invest in robust cybersecurity measures. Halcyon's AI-powered system may help level the playing field, as it can identify and prevent threats before they cause damage. "Halcyon's mission is to protect businesses' most valuable asset: their data," said Sounil Yu, the company's Chief Information Security Officer. "Our AI-driven approach enables us to stay ahead of attackers and provide our customers with the highest level of security.". Yu added that the recent funding would give Halcyon the resources it needs to "expand our technology and solution offerings and bring them to market faster." The company plans to use the funds to not only develop its engineering and R&D departments but also increase its sales and marketing efforts. SYN Ventures, one of the lead investors, was attracted to Halcyon's innovative approach to cybersecurity. "Halcyon has developed a unique AI-driven solution to combat the increasing threat of ransomware," said Gaurav Jain, Managing Partner at SYN Ventures. "We're excited to be supporting them as they continue to develop their technology and expand their customer base.". The investment is a sign of growing demand for cybersecurity solutions in the wake of a surge in cyber attacks. According to a report by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the first six months of 2021 saw an increase in ransomware attacks on critical infrastructure, including healthcare providers and the food and agricultural sector. Halcyon's new data exfiltration tool may prove to be a crucial addition to the company's existing cybersecurity offerings. As ransomware attacks become increasingly sophisticated, Halcyon's AI-powered system may help businesses protect their invaluable data and prevent devastating financial losses. The start-up's plans to expand its workforce and develop new technology with the recent funding bode well for the company's future. As the threat of cyber attacks looms ever larger, it is likely that demand for cybersecurity solutions like Halcyon will only continue to grow.
