Petal, the New York-based fintech startup, has recently secured $140 million in a Series D funding round, bringing its valuation to an impressive $800 million. Since its establishment in 2016, Petal has been on a mission to revolutionize the traditional credit system by providing credit cards to underserved individuals with limited or no credit history. Unlike traditional credit card companies that rely heavily on credit scores, Petal uses cash flow as the primary determinant of creditworthiness. This allows them to offer credit cards to a large number of potential customers who would otherwise be denied by major banks. In fact, more than 40% of Petal's members were initially rejected by traditional financial institutions before becoming cardholders. Over the past year, Petal has witnessed remarkable growth, tripling its user base and quadrupling its revenue. Currently, the company boasts nearly 300,000 cardholders, a testament to its success in tapping into the underserved market of credit applicants with limited credit history. Petal's innovative approach has managed to attract significant interest from investors. With the latest funding round, the startup has raised a total of over $240 million in equity capital and more than $450 million in debt financing. The influx of funds will not only enable Petal to continue expanding its reach but also accelerate its hiring process, with plans to bring on board more than 100 new employees. The $140 million investment will primarily be utilized to add hundreds of thousands of new cardmembers to Petal's ever-growing customer base in the coming year. By doing so, the company aims to reach even more underserved consumers who have traditionally faced difficulty in accessing credit. Additionally, Petal plans to utilize the funding to further enhance its infrastructure, ensuring seamless services to its existing and new customers. Jason Gross, the CEO and co-founder of Petal, expressed his excitement about the recent funding, stating, "This latest round of funding is a significant milestone for Petal. It not only validates our mission to provide accessible credit options to underserved consumers, but also demonstrates the growing recognition of the importance of alternative credit evaluation methods.". Credit is a fundamental aspect of modern society, allowing individuals to make important purchases, build their credit history, and achieve financial stability. However, for those with little or no credit history, accessing credit can be challenging and can hinder their ability to establish and improve their financial standing. Petal's innovative approach disrupts this broken system, offering a solution that evaluates creditworthiness based on a more holistic view of an individual's financial situation. By leveraging cash flow as a key factor, Petal removes barriers for millions of underserved consumers who have often been marginalized by traditional financial institutions. Furthermore, Petal's user-friendly mobile app and its commitment to transparency and usability have contributed to its growing popularity among its target demographic. With the recent funding secured, Petal is poised to continue its impressive growth trajectory and make a significant impact on the credit industry. By empowering individuals with limited credit history to access credit and build their financial futures, Petal is not only disrupting a broken system but also addressing a pressing societal issue. As Petal expands its reach and continues to redefine the credit landscape, it paves the way for a more inclusive and accessible credit system. With the fresh infusion of capital, Petal is well-positioned to challenge traditional credit card companies and move closer to achieving unicorn status in the fintech industry.
