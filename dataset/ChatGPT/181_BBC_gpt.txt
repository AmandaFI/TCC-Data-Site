Ukraine is facing another wave of cyber-attacks, marking the third attack this year. The Ukrainian government has described these attacks as being "on a completely different level", with the latest attack being the most sophisticated to date. The attacks targeted the websites of Ukrainian banks and government departments, rendering them inaccessible to users. The attacks began with distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, which overwhelm websites with requests and cause them to crash. Ukraine's Digital Transformation Minister confirmed that the country experienced a mass DDoS attack. Throughout the day, the attacks intensified, but most websites were restored within a few hours. Cyber-security experts at ESET and Symantec reported the discovery of a second form of attack during the cyber-attacks. They found a new type of "wiper" malware called HermeticWiper that was installed on hundreds of machines in Ukraine. This "wiper" attack destroys data on infected machines, adding another layer of destruction to the already sophisticated cyber-attacks. The Ukrainian government believes that the attacks may have been planned since December 2021. Last week, a smaller-scale cyber-attack also targeted Ukrainian websites, which the UK and US attributed to Russian hackers. However, Russia has denied any involvement in these recent attacks, and no official blame has been placed on them for the latest incidents. It is important to note that the EU recently deployed a cyber rapid-response team (CRRT) to assist Ukraine in defending against cyber-attacks. This deployment shows the seriousness of the situation and the need for immediate action to counter these threats. DDoS attacks have been commonly seen as a part of Russia's "hybrid warfare" tactics, which involve combining cyber-attacks with traditional military activities. Russia has been accused of using DDoS attacks in the past to disrupt Ukrainian infrastructure and services. Notably, previous cyber-attacks blamed on Russia include attacks on electricity substations and the NotPetya "wiper" attack, which caused widespread damage globally. The situation in Ukraine highlights the increasing severity and frequency of cyber-attacks targeting both government institutions and financial organizations. These attacks not only disrupt services but can also potentially compromise sensitive data. Governments and organizations worldwide are becoming increasingly concerned about the potential for cyber-attacks to cause significant harm and destabilize infrastructures. In response to these threats, it is crucial for countries to enhance their cyber-security measures and collaborate with international partners to combat cyber-crime effectively. The deployment of the EU's cyber rapid-response team is a step in the right direction, as it provides immediate support and expertise to assist countries facing such attacks. As investigations continue, it is important for the international community to remain vigilant and hold accountable those responsible for these cyber-attacks. Cyber-security is no longer a local issue but a global concern that requires collective efforts to effectively counter these evolving threats.
