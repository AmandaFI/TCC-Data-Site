Kalakshetra: Sex harassment claims shake top India dance academy. Kalakshetra, a renowned Indian art and cultural institution, has come under fire after allegations of sexual harassment against a faculty member and three substitute teachers were made public. Hari Padman, an assistant professor and dancer, was arrested last week on charges of sexual harassment. The accusations have led to protests by over 200 of the school's students, who allege that sexual harassment has taken place at the campus for years. The Kalakshetra Foundation has suspended Padman and the three repertory artists, pending inquiry. The school has also formed a three-member panel to investigate the allegations. The Tamil Nadu State Commission for Women has launched an inquiry into the incident. The allegations first came to light when a former student of Kalakshetra, Radhika Aiyar, posted a message on her social media page detailing her experience of sexual harassment at the hands of Hari Padman. "I was groped and molested by him during class, and when I tried to bring the matter to the attention of the authorities, I was dismissed and told to keep quiet," she wrote. Aiyar's message quickly went viral, and soon other students came forward with similar stories of harassment. "I too have been harassed by him," wrote another student. "He once cornered me in a room and made advances towards me.". The accusations have sparked a wave of protests and outrage on social media, with many calling for accountability and justice. Students and alumni of Kalakshetra have shared their experiences of harassment, abuse, and discrimination on social media using the hashtag #MeTooKalakshetra. The Kalakshetra Foundation, which was established in 1936 by legendary dancer and choreographer Rukmini Devi Arundale, has a long-standing history of promoting Indian classical dance and music. Kalakshetra has produced some of India's most renowned dancers and musicians over the years, and the institution is widely respected for its contribution to the Indian arts and culture scene. Despite its reputation, the school has been marred by allegations of sexual harassment, discrimination, and abuse for years. Students have alleged that the administration has been turning a blind eye to the problems and that they have been silenced or dismissed when they try to complain. In a statement released by the Kalakshetra Foundation, the school said it was "deeply troubled" by the allegations and was taking steps to address them. "We take any allegation of sexual harassment or abuse very seriously, and we do not tolerate such behavior in any form. We are conducting a thorough investigation into the matter, and we are committed to taking appropriate action based on the findings.". The statement also acknowledged the other allegations of verbal abuse, body shaming, caste discrimination, and a lack of freedom at Kalakshetra. "We are aware that there are other issues that need to be addressed, and we are committed to creating a safe and supportive environment for all our students.". Meanwhile, the students of Kalakshetra have demanded more action from the school. In a letter to the Kalakshetra Foundation, they have demanded the formation of a grievance redressal cell and an independent complaints committee to deal with harassment and abuse cases. They have also asked for the implementation of a gender-sensitive policy and training programs for the staff and students. "We welcome the steps taken by the school, but we also want to ensure that this is not just a knee-jerk response to the current situation," said Anjali Thakur, a student at Kalakshetra. "We want to see lasting changes that will make Kalakshetra a safe and inclusive space for all students.". The Kalakshetra incident is the latest in a series of high-profile cases of sexual harassment and abuse in India's arts and culture scene. In 2018, renowned classical dancer and choreographer, MJ Akbar, resigned from his post as India's Minister of State for External Affairs after over 20 women accused him of sexual harassment and abuse. The #MeToo movement in India has brought to light numerous cases of sexual harassment and abuse in various industries, including media, politics, and entertainment. The incident at Kalakshetra underscores the need for stronger laws and policies to prevent and address sexual harassment and abuse in workplace and educational institutions across India. While progress has been made in recent years, incidents like this show that much more needs to be done to create safe and inclusive spaces for everyone.
