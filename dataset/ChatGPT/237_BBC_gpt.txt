Influencers in Australia could face up to five years in jail for breaking finance tips rules, according to new information released by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC). The regulatory body conducted a survey in 2021, which revealed that 33% of 18 to 21-year-olds follow financial influencers, and 64% of young Australians have altered their financial behavior as a result of influencer recommendations. ASIC commissioner Cathie Armour highlighted the importance of adhering to financial services laws in order to protect investors from potential risks. The information sheet provided by ASIC outlined examples of statements that could be classified as financial advice, and cautioned against making misleading statements about financial products. It also stated that sharing affiliate links to online brokers may require a license. The use of influencers in promoting financial products and cryptocurrencies has also caught the attention of regulatory bodies in other countries. The UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has expressed concerns about the practice and has taken steps to regulate misleading promotions of crypto-assets. In January, the UK Treasury proposed new laws in this area, while the FCA launched a consultation on strengthening rules for marketing high-risk financial products. Additionally, Spain's National Securities Market Commission has announced plans for new regulations regarding the advertising of crypto-assets, including promotions by social media influencers. The growing influence of social media has made it easier for individuals to share financial advice and recommendations. However, this also raises concerns about the accuracy and credibility of the information being presented. Regulators are particularly concerned about the potential for misleading statements and the impact they can have on investors, especially young and inexperienced ones. The recent move by ASIC to highlight the potential legal implications for influencers is part of a broader crackdown on misleading financial advice and promotions. The regulatory body has been actively monitoring social media platforms and taking action against individuals and companies found to be in violation of financial services laws. The ASIC information sheet serves as a warning to influencers in Australia, reminding them of their responsibilities when providing financial advice. Aleks Nikolic, a social media user who provides financial investment information, welcomed the communication from ASIC and commended the clarity it offers. The survey conducted by ASIC highlights the significant impact that financial influencers have on young Australians. With a considerable number of young individuals changing their financial behavior based on influencer recommendations, it becomes crucial to ensure that the information being shared is accurate, reliable, and meets regulatory requirements. As regulators around the world take steps to address the risks associated with financial advice from influencers, it is expected that more countries will introduce regulations to govern this area. The use of social media platforms as a means to disseminate financial information continues to grow, and it is essential for investors to have access to trustworthy and transparent advice to make informed decisions. In the midst of this changing landscape, regulators such as ASIC in Australia are taking proactive steps to protect investors by raising awareness about the potential legal implications of providing misleading financial advice. This development signifies a new era where influencers will be held accountable for their recommendations and underscores the need for individuals to be cautious and discerning when considering financial advice from social media platforms.
