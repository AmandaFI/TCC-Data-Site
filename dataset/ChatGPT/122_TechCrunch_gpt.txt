The concept of a universal basic income (UBI) is gaining momentum in Silicon Valley as disruptive technologies continue to replace jobs, but computer scientist Jaron Lanier is proposing an alternative solution: "data dignity". In a world where powerful AI models are heavily reliant on the data we constantly feed them, Lanier argues that the people contributing to these models should be rewarded for their efforts. The problem, however, lies in how to assign people the appropriate amount of credit for the countless contributions they make online. Although the idea is not a new one, it could offer a solution to prevent the extreme outcomes predicted by UBI advocates. Lanier believes that AI models must be "connected with the humans" who supply them with data, and that credit must be given where it is due. In an age where automation is rapidly replacing jobs, relying on UBI alone may create a culture of dependency and even greater inequality. Data dignity, however, could give people added dignity and value, reflecting the vital role they play in machine learning and automation. But how would Lanier's concept work in practice?. The issue lies in how to disentangle everything that AI models have absorbed from all the different contributions by individuals. For instance, a simple Google search requires the data input of millions of individuals, each contributing their own set of information. Delineating the impact each person has had on an AI model's success would require a detailed and complex accounting system. While a few proposals have been suggested, there is no standardized system yet in place. Despite this rocky landscape, Lanier thinks it could be done, and gradually. "Data dignity" supporters are drafting principles outlining more transparent approaches to data, AI, and algorithmic justice. They are advocating for the creation of a "data commons," where data is shared and analyzed in a more open and equitable manner. The goal is to create a standard whereby individuals can see how their data is being used, have more control over its flow, and can demand compensation for its use. But before we can reach this level of transparency, the tech industry also needs to change its approach to data and how it is used. Unfortunately, the current system favors companies that have access to large amounts of data and can develop the most sophisticated algorithms. Recently, OpenAI, one of the leading groups working on advanced AI applications, has faced criticism for limiting access to its technology. This limitation is seen by some as an attempt to monopolize data and the advancements it can produce. Such monopolies could make it extremely difficult for individuals to take an active role in their own data and data dignity, creating deep inequalities between those who have access and those who do not. Furthermore, many businesses don't yet see the importance of assigning credit or value to the contributions people make to data sets. For example, Twitter uses algorithms to help individuals curate their feeds, but it is unclear how the company weights user interactions that impact these algorithms. Assigning value or credit to such interactions would be a first step towards recognizing individuals' contributions to the algorithms that make Twitter successful. Some are pushing for even more radical solutions to this problem, including platforms that allow users to monetize their own data. New systems such as Solid, an open-source platform developed by the inventor of the World Wide Web Tim Berners-Lee, emphasize the idea that individuals should have more control and agency over their own personal data. Solid is designed so that individuals can control where and how their personal data is being used, potentially opening the door to paying individuals for their data contributions. In conclusion, Lanier's concept of data dignity has the potential to remove the sense of dependency that may arise from a universal basic income system. It recognizes the importance of how people's data contributions make it possible for machines to learn and evolve. However, the practicality of implementing such a system is still fraught with difficulties. As society continues to grapple with the intricacies of assigning value and credit to data contributions, we need to ensure that data is shared and analyzed in an equitable manner. Only then can we hope to create meaningful change in the way we view data and algorithmic justice.
