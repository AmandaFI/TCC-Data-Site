Cortical Labs, an Australian startup, has secured $10m in funding from a round led by Horizons Ventures, along with participation from LifeX Ventures, Blackbird Ventures, Radar Ventures, and In-Q-Tel. The company combines synthetic biology and human neurons to develop a type of AI called “Organoid Intelligence” (OI). They have created “DishBrains,” lab-cultivated clusters of human stem cells, which are connected to hard silicon to create a Biological Intelligence Operating System (biOS). The company claims that human neurons could be more efficient for generalized intelligence than digital AI models because they are self-programming and require less energy consumption. Cortical Labs' technology has raised interest in developing a new breed of machine intelligence. The company uses gene editing technology to grow human cells in a petri dish, which can play Pong. The cells are self-organizing and self-programming, and they can respond to external stimuli. The neuron clusters are then connected to silicon chips to create neural networks, which process data in a way that mimics the human brain. The technology has gained admiration for its exploration into the development of self-programming intelligence. Traditional AI models rely on massive amounts of data and computing power, making the production expensive and unsustainable. Cortical Labs' DishBrains, however, are self-programming, meaning they learn and adapt over time, requiring significantly less computing power than the traditional AI models. The technology could lead to significant advancements in the field of AI. The company claims that OI would be more human-like than digital AI models, making it more suitable for tasks such as detecting patterns, learning new tasks, and decision-making. The technology could also be used in fields such as medical research, where it could help create personalized medicines. The funding will enable Cortical Labs to expand the development of DishBrains and biOS. The company has already fulfilled orders for the technology, and the funding will allow them to scale up production. Observers believe that the company has significant growth potential given the demand for next-generation AI technology. Cortical Labs is not the only company developing biologically-inspired AI models. Others include BrainChip, which uses neuromorphic chips to process data like the human brain, and Neuromorphic.ai, which uses artificial intelligence to develop neural networks. However, Cortical Labs differs by using actual human cells to create neural networks, giving it an additional edge in human-like intelligence. The company's CEO, Jennifer Von Briesen, said that the funding from the latest round would help the company grow and transform the future of AI. "Our technology represents a significant step forward in the development of more human-like AI models, which could revolutionize industries from healthcare to finance, entertainment, and beyond," she said. "We are excited to be working with our investors to bring DishBrains and biOS into the mainstream and change the way we think about AI.". Horizons Ventures, the lead investor in the funding round, is a leading venture capital firm with a focus on disruptive technology. It has been known for investing in innovative ventures like Waze, Siri, Improbable, and more. The firm's aim is to help groundbreaking ventures reach their full potential by providing them with strategic advice and supporting their development. In conclusion, Cortical Labs' growth potential is likely to benefit from the expansive demand for AI technology. With its unique approach to AI through the use of human cells, the company is well-positioned to scale up and attract a broader base of customers. The technology it develops could eventually transform industries through improved data processing, personalisation, and decision-making. The latest funding round is just the tip of the iceberg, with expansion set to take place in the near future for Cortical Labs.
