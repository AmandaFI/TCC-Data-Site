Younger workers will benefit from return to office, says boss. CEO of City Pub Group, Clive Watson, has stated that returning to work in offices will benefit younger employees and their careers. He argues that junior staff require mentors and guidance that they cannot easily receive while working remotely. Watson believes that working in an office helps build the "culture" of a business and promotes mental well-being. After months of remote working due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many people are set to return to the office this week following the lifting of work-from-home guidance in England. Transport for London reported a 6% increase in tube journeys compared to the previous week, indicating a potential return of commuters to city and town centres. However, Network Rail stated that it was too soon to determine if this trend would continue. The pandemic has had a significant impact on businesses in city centres, with a Centre for Cities report revealing that they have lost over a third of their potential earnings and thousands have closed since March 2020. The return to the office is seen as a crucial step towards recovery for these businesses. While some employers argue that working from the office is more productive, many believe that flexible working is here to stay. A BBC survey found that 70% of respondents did not believe workers would return to the office full-time post-pandemic. The shift towards remote work during the pandemic has highlighted the benefits for employees, such as improved well-being and cost savings. However, Clive Watson argues that younger employees may miss out on crucial mentorship opportunities if remote work becomes the norm. "Junior staff require mentors, guidance, advice, and to build relationships that cannot easily occur through remote means. For younger workers, the office environment can be essential for career progression," he says. Supporting Watson's perspective, Laura Thompson, a junior employee in a marketing firm, expresses how important it is for her to be back in the office. "Working from home has its advantages, but being in the office allows me to learn from more experienced colleagues, get immediate feedback, and feel connected to the company's culture," she says. However, not all employees share the same sentiment. Sarah Patel, a project manager, highlights the benefits of working from home. "Remote work gives me the flexibility to balance my personal and professional life. It has improved my well-being and reduced commute-related stress. I feel more productive and have been able to save money on transport and lunches," she explains. The Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD) expects most employers to continue implementing hybrid working arrangements, offering a mix of office and remote work. According to the CIPD, this will be a crucial aspect of attracting and retaining talent in the post-pandemic work landscape. Safety concerns have been raised by unions, as the return to the office coincides with the spread of the Delta variant of COVID-19. However, it is ultimately up to employers to carry out risk assessments and provide a safe working environment. Employers have a legal obligation to ensure a safe workplace, taking into consideration measures such as enhanced cleaning, ventilation, and social distancing. Currently, there is no legal right for employees to work from home. While employers can require employees to return to the office, they also have a responsibility to prioritize health and safety. The balance between office and remote work will likely continue to be a topic of discussion in the months to come, as businesses navigate the ongoing impacts of the pandemic.
