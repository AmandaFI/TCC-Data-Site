Amazon has secured the top spot in LinkedIn's annual rankings of the best places to work. However, the rankings are not just based on practical assessments, but also on a company's softer and cultural skills, reflecting how long an employee is likely to stay with the company. LinkedIn has noticed a shift in jobseeker priorities towards workplaces that align with their values, including factors such as diversity and skills growth. The rankings reflect this change, with big tech companies such as Google and Meta not making the top five. LinkedIn has launched a new tool for jobseekers that allows them to filter their searches according to policies and priorities such as diversity and inclusion, career growth and learning, work-life balance, social impact and environmental sustainability. This has come at a time when company culture is more important than ever for potential employees. In addition to salary and benefits, jobseekers are now looking beyond the surface and examining what organizations stand for in order to determine where they want to work. It is no longer just about getting a job, but also about working for a company that reflects one's personal beliefs and values. LinkedIn's new tool is a reflection of this shift as it connects jobseekers with organizations that share these same priorities. Amazon has emerged as the leader in this new employment game. The company has invested heavily in its employees' development, offering training, tuition reimbursement, and internal mobility programs. The company has also implemented a number of policies to improve diversity and inclusion. In 2020, Amazon increased the number of black and Latino senior managers by 30%, and women now make up nearly half of the company's workforce. In second place, Goldman Sachs provides its employees with various opportunities for learning and growth through a range of training programs and networking opportunities. The bank has also introduced a number of policies to support employees' mental health and work-life balance. Third on LinkedIn's list is Hilti, a global leader in the construction industry. The company offers extensive training and development opportunities for its employees, as well as a number of programs aimed at improving diversity and inclusion. In fourth place, Cisco Systems has a strong focus on employee well-being, offering flexible work arrangements and comprehensive health benefits. The company also provides its employees with extensive opportunities for learning and growth through its internal training programs. Finally, in fifth place, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital offers its employees the opportunity to make a meaningful difference by working to save the lives of children with cancer and other life-threatening diseases. The hospital also offers a range of training and development programs for its employees. While these companies are all leaders in their respective industries, what sets them apart is their commitment to workplace culture. They have shown that investing in their employees' development, prioritizing diversity and inclusion, and creating a positive work environment are all essential components to retaining talent and building a successful organization. LinkedIn's rankings reflect a shift in the employment game, with jobseeker priorities shifting towards workplace culture and alignment with personal values. As organizations adapt to this change, it is becoming increasingly clear that competitive salaries and benefits are no longer enough. To attract top talent, organizations must prioritize company culture and the values that are important to potential employees.
