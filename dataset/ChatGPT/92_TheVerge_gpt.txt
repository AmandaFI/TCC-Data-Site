Google's new chatbot, Bard, is entering the beta testing phase, promising users a new way to interact with the search engine. However, concerns are already mounting over how the chatbot could be used, with some users treating it as a replacement for traditional search engines. Google has said that Bard is designed as a complement to its search engine, not a replacement, but the company has limited control over how the chatbot is used. The company has said that Bard is a general-purpose chatbot, designed to provide users with a fun and engaging way to interact with Google. However, the chatbot's user interface still looks like a search engine, and some users may be using it as a search engine replacement without realizing that the answers they receive may not be accurate. Google is being cautious in its approach to Bard, as the chatbot's use could potentially harm its search business. While Bard is mostly used for creative ideas and low-stakes questions, the company has said that it could include AI-generated answers from the chatbot in its search results. "We developed Bard to be a complement to our search engine, not a replacement," a Google spokesperson said. "However, we recognize that users may use Bard as a search engine replacement, and we are taking steps to ensure that the chatbot is used in the right way.". The company has been careful to limit Bard's scope to only what it does well, and has tried to create limits to prevent users from using the chatbot as a full-fledged search engine. However, some users have already tested the chatbot as a search engine replacement, and the company may need to take additional measures to prevent this from happening in the future. Google has said that it will be closely monitoring how users are interacting with Bard during the beta testing phase, and will be making adjustments to the chatbot's functionality and user interface as needed. The company has also said that it is committed to the transparency and accuracy of its search results, and will only include Bard's AI-generated answers in its search results if they meet its strict quality standards. Despite these concerns, Google is optimistic about the potential of Bard, and believes that the chatbot could play a valuable role in the company's broader efforts to develop new AI-powered products and services. "We see Bard as a great way to explore new ideas and push the boundaries of what's possible with AI," the Google spokesperson said. "We're excited to see what users will do with the chatbot, and we're committed to making sure it is used in the right way.".
