National Public Radio (NPR) in the US has stopped using Twitter after a disagreement over how the social media platform describes the outlet. Twitter has described NPR as "government-funded media", a label NPR claims undermines its credibility. The US government funds less than 1% of its budget, a fact that NPR argues should not be used to define it. Elon Musk, the owner of Twitter, recently agreed to change the label on the BBC's Twitter account following similar disputes. However, Musk responded to NPR's criticism with a series of tweets, accusing the outlet of inconsistency. NPR is a non-profit media organisation that operates across America and around the world. Its journalism is supported by a combination of listener donations, corporate sponsors, and government grants. While NPR has received some funding from the US government in the past, it argues that this should not define its identity. Twitter's label as "government-funded media" appears to have been the source of the dispute between the two organisations. On 23 August, NPR announced that it would suspend its use of Twitter, citing the "government-funded media" label as one of the reasons for its decision. In a statement, NPR said that Twitter's description "is inaccurate and undermines the credibility of NPR's journalism". Twitter responded by defending the label, saying that it was "based on publicly available information about NPR's funding sources". However, Twitter also acknowledged that it was open to changing the description if NPR could provide "new information that would warrant a change". The dispute between NPR and Twitter is not the first time that the social media platform has been criticised for its labelling of media organisations. In May 2021, Elon Musk agreed to change the label on the BBC's Twitter account from "state-affiliated media" to "news organisation". The move followed complaints from the BBC, which argued that the previous label was unfair and misleading. However, Musk expressed scepticism about NPR's claims, suggesting that the outlet had been inconsistent in its coverage of certain issues. In a series of tweets, Musk pointed out that NPR had described him as a "billionaire" in previous reports, despite his assets being primarily held in stocks rather than cash. He also cited examples of what he saw as biased coverage of Tesla, the electric car manufacturer that he founded. Musk's tweets sparked a lively debate on social media, with some commentators supporting his criticisms of NPR, while others accused him of trying to distract attention from Twitter's handling of the dispute. NPR has encouraged its supporters to follow its content on other social media platforms and to subscribe to its newsletters as an alternative to Twitter. In a statement, NPR said that it remained committed to providing quality journalism that was "free from political influence". The organisation has a long history of producing award-winning investigative reporting on a wide range of topics, including politics, science, and social justice issues. The dispute over Twitter's labelling of NPR highlights the growing concern among media organisations about the role of social media in shaping public discourse. The accuracy and impartiality of news reporting are under increasing scrutiny in an age where information travels faster than ever before. Twitter, in particular, has come under fire in recent years for its handling of controversial figures such as former US President Donald Trump, who was banned from the platform following the January 6 Capitol riots. The issue of government funding for media organisations is also a contentious one. While NPR argues that its journalism is free from political influence, critics have suggested that its reliance on corporate sponsors and government grants could affect its editorial independence. The label of "government-funded media" could be seen as an attempt to discredit NPR's work and to undermine public trust in its reporting. In conclusion, the decision by NPR to suspend its use of Twitter highlights the tensions that exist between media organisations and social media platforms. While Twitter argues that its description of NPR is based on public information, NPR believes that the label undermines its credibility as a news organisation. The debate over funding for media organisations and the role of social media in shaping public discourse are likely to continue for some time to come.
