Yelp, the popular online review platform, is set to revamp its existing review feature by allowing users to add videos alongside text and photos. The San Francisco-based company introduced this new feature to enhance the overall context of a user's experience at a particular location. With a 12-second recording time limit, Yelp users can now narrate and visually showcase the details of their experience and share it with other potential visitors. This feature, which has already been rolled out in the United States, is expected to create a more engaging and insightful platform for new and seasoned users. In line with this update, Yelp is also introducing artificial intelligence (AI)-powered tools aimed at enhancing the user experience. One of the new features includes highlighting relevant information in reviews and suggesting topics to write about. It is expected to create more useful reviews while lessening the burden of writing for users. Additionally, the new “surprise me” button, another AI-powered tool, will suggest highly-rated places to eat in a user's area, making Yelp more than just a reviewing platform but also an ideal discovery tool to explore the city's unique culinary landscape. These significant additions are part of a series of updates that the company has introduced to enhance its user experience. Yelp has made it much easier to modify reviews, especially for the first time, with a new editing tool that allows users to correct mistakes or add more details that they want to share. Yelp's latest updates will be an efficient way for businesses to communicate with potential customers through reviews and videos, making it easier for customers to get an accurate picture of different locations, attractions, and restaurants.
