The Internet Archive is facing a legal battle in New York today as publishers take action against its Open Library program. The program, which allows libraries to digitize their physical books and offer them as e-books on a limited one-to-one basis, has been accused of violating copyright law and representing piracy on an industrial scale. The case, brought forward by major book publishers Hachette Book Group, HarperCollins Publishers, John Wiley & Sons, and Penguin Random House, has significant implications for the preservation of digital copies of books in libraries. Unlike OverDrive and Amazon's Kindle library program, the Open Library program operates outside of traditional licensing agreements. Publishers argue that this means they are unable to control the distribution of their copyrighted material and that the CDL practice allows for the proliferation of pirated copies. The Open Library program was launched in 2006 with the aim of providing greater access to literature for those who may not otherwise have access to physical copies. Libraries can loan out e-books on a one-to-one basis for a limited time before the copy is returned and made available to another user. The National Emergency Library, which was launched earlier this year in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, allowed for unlimited users to access e-books, regardless of the one-to-one borrowing restrictions. The publishers argue that this service contributed to the potential loss of sales and did not adhere to fair-use policies. The Internet Archive, a nonprofit organization, has defended its CDL practice, stating that it is legal under the fair-use doctrine. The doctrine allows for the limited use of copyrighted material without obtaining permission from the copyright holder, under certain circumstances. The Internet Archive argues that the CDL practice is transformative, as it allows for greater access to literature and provides a digital backup of physical copies that are at risk of being destroyed by natural disasters or other unforeseen events. The library also points to the fact that the CDL practice has been in operation for nearly a decade, and no legal action has been taken against it until now. The Internet Archive notes that Hachette and other publishers have previously donated physical copies of books to the organization for digitization, indicating a level of agreement with the program. The case has generated significant interest from the library community, as it has important implications for the preservation of digital copies of books. The Open Library program is one of the few options available for libraries to provide greater access to literature without paying exorbitant licensing fees to publishers. The library community argues that the CDL practice falls within fair-use policies and is necessary for the preservation of literature in the digital age. They have also stated that the National Emergency Library was launched in response to the pandemic and provided much-needed access to literature during a time of crisis. The case is set to be closely watched by all involved in the digital publishing industry. The outcome may have far-reaching implications for how libraries can preserve digital copies of books and provide access to literature in the future.
