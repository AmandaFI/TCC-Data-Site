The people deciding to ditch their smartphones. In an age dominated by technology and constant connectivity, a growing number of individuals are making the decision to eschew their smartphones in favor of simpler, stripped-down devices. Reasons for this shift range from concerns about mental health and addiction to setting a good example for children and reducing screen time. As the trend gains steam, experts are offering suggestions on how to reduce smartphone usage and regain control of one's life. One such individual who made the choice to abandon their smartphone is Dulcie Cowling. Realizing how much time she and others spent on their smartphones, she decided to switch to an old Nokia phone. For Cowling, the decision was driven by a desire to improve her mental health by engaging more in real-life experiences rather than mindlessly scrolling through social media feeds. By eliminating the constant stream of notifications and distractions, Cowling found that she was able to focus more on her personal well-being and connect with the world around her. Similarly, Alex Dunedin opted to give up his smartphone two years ago due to concerns over addiction and the environmental impact of constantly upgrading to the latest models. Instead, Dunedin now relies on email as his primary form of communication. By doing so, he has experienced a newfound sense of freedom and detachment from the constant barrage of messages and notifications that come with owning a smartphone. For him, this lifestyle change has resulted in improved concentration and reduced stress. However, not all individuals who have bid adieu to their smartphones have done so permanently. Lynne Voyce reluctantly returned to using a smartphone last year but plans to abandon it once again after the pandemic subsides. In 2016, Voyce had initially given up her smartphone as a way to set a good example for her daughters and reduce their screen time. Acknowledging the benefits of smartphones as essential lifelines for many, especially in terms of access to healthcare, education, and social services, Voyce decided to temporarily reintegrate one into her life. Yet, she remains determined to return to the simplicity and freedom that come with being disconnected from the digital world. While smartphones undoubtedly provide numerous advantages, heavy usage is linked to a range of negative effects. Relationship issues, compromised sleep quality, decreased ability to relax and concentrate, and a constant sense of urgency are just some of the downsides associated with excessive screen time. To combat these issues, experts recommend a variety of strategies to reduce smartphone usage without completely disconnecting. Apps such as Freedom and Off The Grid can be utilized to limit and block access to specific applications and websites, effectively managing distractions and reducing mindless scrolling. Monitoring screen time and setting daily limits can contribute to a healthy balance between digital engagement and real-world experiences. Additionally, carving out phone-free periods throughout the day allows individuals to prioritize self-care and meaningful interactions. Screensavers that remind users of more valuable ways to spend their time serve as a gentle, constant reminder to engage in activities that enrich their lives. The decision to abandon a smartphone in favor of a simpler, less connected device is a personal one. For Cowling, Dunedin, and Voyce, it represents a conscious choice to prioritize mental health, environmental concerns, and personal freedom. As the trend continues to gain traction, it prompts reflection on our relationship with technology and the ways in which we can reclaim control over our lives. Whether through intentional app usage, reduced screen time, or the complete abandonment of smartphones, individuals are making a collective effort to strike a balance between their digital lives and the world beyond the screen.
