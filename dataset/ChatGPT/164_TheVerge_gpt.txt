Two top executives involved in the development of former President Donald Trump's alternative social networking platform, Truth Social, have resigned from their positions. Chief Technology Officer Josh Adams and Head of Product Development Billy Boozer left the company less than a year after joining the project, signaling potential troubles for the newly launched platform. The resignations come after a highly problematic debut for the Truth Social app on February 20th, which was plagued with technical glitches and a 13-hour outage. Since its launch, the app has made little improvement, with new users still being placed on a waitlist to join. This lack of progress and functionality may have contributed to the decision of the two executives to leave the company. Truth Social was created by Trump as an alternative to mainstream social media platforms after he was banned from Twitter following the January 6th riots at the US Capitol. Initially starting as a blog on his campaign website, the project then teamed up with Rumble, a free speech YouTube alternative, under the umbrella of the Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG). In its early stages, Truth Social garnered significant attention and became the top-downloaded app for social networking on Apple's App Store. However, its popularity has rapidly declined since then, currently ranking 28th on the store. According to analytics firm Apptopia, daily downloads plummeted from 170,000 to around 8,000. The official launch of Truth Social on other platforms, such as Google Play Store, has yet to be announced, leaving the app limited to Apple users for the time being. The Trump Media & Technology Group has been tight-lipped about the future of the platform and has not responded to requests for comments regarding the recent resignations. It remains unclear if replacements have been found for the departing executives, and their exit raises questions about the direction and stability of Truth Social. Building a successful social networking platform from scratch is a complex task, and the departures may indicate underlying issues within the company. With the social media landscape dominated by the likes of Facebook and Twitter, it remains to be seen if Truth Social can carve out a significant user base. The recent setbacks, including the resignations of key executives, technical glitches, and a drop in popularity, suggest the platform still has a long way to go to establish itself as a viable alternative in the crowded social media market.
