In a major move towards improving working conditions in the gaming industry, Epic Games, the developer of the popular game Fortnite, has announced that it will be offering full-time employment and benefits to its contingent workers in the United States. This includes quality assurance (QA) testers and other eligible contract-based employees. The news was revealed in an internal memo obtained by The Verge. According to the memo, eligible contingent workers will be offered full-time at-will employment, with the majority of the offers set to become effective on April 4, 2022. However, there will be exceptions where it is mutually beneficial for both the worker and Epic to maintain contingent worker status. It has been confirmed by Epic Games spokesperson Elka Looks that the company plans to hire "a few hundred" of its contractors, mainly focusing on QA testers. All the workers who are hired will be eligible for the company's US employee benefits plans and will be directly employed by Epic Games. It is worth noting that currently, the studio contracts out QA testers and other workers through temporary agencies. Despite the decision to hire full-time employees, Epic Games will still hire contingent workers for short-term needs. However, Looks did not provide specific information on the types of workers, other than QA testers, that Epic will hire, nor did she clarify which workers are excluded from this new offer. This move by Epic Games comes at a time of high tension between workers and major game development studios. The gaming industry has long been criticized for subjecting workers to long and sometimes unpaid work hours during periods known as "crunch." Epic Games itself faced criticism in 2019 when workers revealed the extensive workdays required to maintain the popular game Fortnite. In response to these concerns, the company took the step of closing its studios for two weeks. Last year, Epic Games also drew criticism when it ended its COVID-era policy that allowed workers to take every other Friday off. This decision led to dissatisfaction among employees. In contrast, some independent developers, such as Young Horses and Crow Crow Crow, have transitioned to a four-day workweek, offering their employees an improved work-life balance. The decision by Epic Games to make contract-based workers full-time employees is seen as a significant step towards addressing these issues and improving working conditions for QA testers and other workers in the gaming industry. It is hoped that other major game development studios will follow suit, creating a better environment for those involved in the creation and maintenance of these popular games.
