Amazon's Sidewalk protocol has recently been opened up to third-party developers, raising concerns over privacy. Sidewalk is a mesh network that uses people's home internet connections across the US as a service, allowing devices to communicate with each other even when out of range of WiFi or Bluetooth. Users were already able to track their lost Tile devices beyond Bluetooth's range by accessing the network, but with more third-party developers joining in, privacy concerns are on the rise. The network uses three layers of encryption for privacy and security, but there are still worries about the certification process and privacy policies for third-party developers that haven't yet been revealed. Critics also point out that Amazon launched Sidewalk as an opt-out service, meaning that users would be automatically enrolled, and the setting to turn it off is not easy to find in the Alexa app. Users were worried that the service would steal internet bandwidth, but Amazon has set a limit at 500 MB per month to prevent this from happening. While Sidewalk has remained relatively controversy-free, that could soon change. Privacy advocates are concerned that the opening up of the protocol to third-party developers could lead to serious privacy breaches if appropriate measures are not put in place. They also worry that Amazon, which already has a significant amount of data on its users, will be further able to track their movements and habits through connected devices. Experts say that Amazon needs to make its certification process and privacy policies for third-party developers more transparent to alleviate privacy concerns. They also recommend that Amazon improve the opt-out process so that users can easily turn off Sidewalk if they do not feel comfortable using it. Amazon has defended Sidewalk, stating that it is a secure and privacy-protective service that helps devices work better for customers. The company says that it is taking steps to ensure that third-party developers follow strict guidelines and regulations when using the service. However, some privacy advocates remain unconvinced. They argue that Amazon has a track record of prioritizing profits over privacy and that Sidewalk should never have been launched as an opt-out service. Regardless of one's opinion on Sidewalk, the recent developments highlight the importance of protecting privacy in our increasingly connected world. As more devices become interconnected, the risk of privacy breaches grows. It is up to tech companies like Amazon to ensure that appropriate privacy protocols are in place before launching new services. Failure to do so could result in serious consequences, both for consumers and the companies involved.
