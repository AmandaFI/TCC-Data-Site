Twitter has likely left its platform vulnerable to manipulation by state propaganda troll farms from Russia and China after eliminating a crucial combat team, according to a new report from the BBC. The unit targeted information operations; these are coordinated campaigns run by countries seeking to influence public opinion and disrupt democracy. Specialist members of the team have asked for anonymity due to online threats and non-disclosure agreements. A former senior employee of Twitter commented that “The whole human layer has been wiped out. All Twitter has left are automated detections systems.”. The report highlights how Russian and Chinese troll farms are still thriving on Twitter. The report will raise concerns that Twitter is failing to take enough action against online interference from hostile nations that could impact national security and democracies. It will also come as the US Presidential campaign heats up, increasing the risks of disinformation and fake news from state propaganda troll farms. Twitter’s own data reveals that it removed over 170,000 suspended accounts linked to China that spread disinformation around the Hong Kong protests, and also over 35,000 accounts linked to Russian trolls ahead of the US elections during the 2016 campaign cycle. However, since the team’s departure, Twitter will likely find it far harder to combat these efforts. Experts and former employees fear that Twitter's new system leaves the company open to manipulation. Twitter’s automated detection systems work on identifying suspected bots, mass-account creation, and tweet spam. While the system is useful, experts say that it lacks the insight and intuition of expert human operators. The new systems may be good at identifying large scale and completely obvious disinformation campaigns, but they may struggle with more complex, subtle ones, leaving Twitter users open to Russian and Chinese propaganda. These concerns come amid increased pressure on social media platforms. Twitter and Facebook have both recently been called to testify before sending representatives to Capitol Hill and answer questions from the US Congress. Lawmakers and experts are concerned that these platforms could be vulnerable to interference from Russia and other nations. Social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and Google are critical tools used by millions of people daily. Their algorithms highlight news stories, shape public opinion and control what people see, and what they buy. But these powerful corporations are now realizing that while they can impact public opinion and help organize grassroots movements, they can equally be used by nefarious actors to manipulate behaviors by spreading disinformation. The rise of online propaganda has led to governments and other special interest groups around the world using social media platforms to further their objectives. These can range from influencing major political events like elections, influencing voter sentiment, and controlling discourse around controversial events. Russian troll farms are believed to have been behind several online campaigns in the US to influence public opinion ahead of the 2016 election. More recently, several reports have surfaced that suggest other governments are also using social media bots and trolls to spread disinformation.The issue is complicated by the fact that in many instances, it can be challenging to distinguish between genuine social media messages and propaganda created by the trolls. Twitter’s combat team was set up to detect and remove such propaganda from its platform. However, the team fell victim to staffing cuts. According to the BBC report, the specialist staff were only replaced by automated systems. The move leaves Twitter exposed to disinformation campaigns that may seek to influence future political events like elections or critical events. The move will raise concerns with social media users and governments alike, as countries around the world seek to shore up their cybersecurity defenses. It also highlights the ongoing concerns about the influence of foreign powers and troll army campaigns. The debate around the influence of social media on public opinion is likely to continue, and while Twitter is facing criticism here, its competitors are also under fire. Facebook was criticized for allowing fake news during the 2016 US elections to spread rapidly across the platform, something CEO Mark Zuckerberg has since conceded. Google has also come under scrutiny for allowing state-sponsored propaganda to be shared on its platforms. The rise of disinformation campaigns will likely continue to pose a challenge for Twitter and other social media platforms. However, the loss of its combat team suggests that Twitter’s capabilities of detecting and removing these campaigns are now at risk. In the wake of the news, Twitter could come under renewed pressure, especially ahead of the 2020 US Presidential election cycle.
