Prepare Your Ears for Wikipedia's 'Sound of All Human Knowledge'. The Wikimedia Foundation, the non-profit that coordinates and operates Wikipedia and other free knowledge projects, has recently announced the adoption of a "sound logo" for its platforms. In the wake of a global contest, Thaddeus Osborne's entry featuring a five-tone melody was selected from 3,235 submissions from 2,094 participants across 135 countries. Osborne, a part-time music producer and nuclear engineer from Australia, created the sound for the contest as he believed that Wikipedia deserved a “sound of all human knowledge”. His winning entry features numerous musical styles but relies essentially on five short notes representing the letters "W-I-K-I". Osborne was awarded $500 as part of the prize and his sound will now be used on all of the Wikimedia Foundation’s online platforms. Currently, Wikipedia's only audio is located under its Media Viewer feature, which allows for the playing of audio files when available and when clicked. However, the adoption of the sound logo now allows for the integration of sounds in various forms across Wikimedia websites - a move that has excited those within the Wikimedia Foundation. The foundation plans to produce a studio-recorded version of the sound and many different versions for use in various contexts. Moreover, Wikimedia Foundation also plans to team up with significant Internet Service Providers in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and other underserved regions to provide zero-rating access to its sites. It will also help content providers identify and schedule around national events in their countries when the demand for local content typically spikes. Netha Hussain, a volunteer science communicator in India, who was part of the judging panel, praised Osborne’s sound logo creation, likening it to a “multicultural symphony”. She also expressed her delight at the global nature of the contest noting that it was “overwhelming” to see the range of submissions from entrants over 135 countries. . Wikimedia is founded with the mission of making information accessible to everyone, and this move towards a sound version of the Wikimedia’s digital presence proves its continuous pursuit of making knowledge available in all formats. Their decision to work with technology partners to better identify and respond to content usage in different regions is further testament to their commitment towards the pursuit of creating new ways to make knowledge sharing accessible to all.
