This firm made Republicans go viral â€” now it's falling apart. Arsenal Media, a campaign shop in Republican politics that gained attention for its viral advertising strategies, is facing internal turmoil as former employees describe a chaotic working environment characterized by internal bullying, toxic HR practices, and a culture of secrecy. The company claims to have a secret formula for making conservative content go viral, using a "viral influencer network." However, recent revelations suggest a different reality. One major issue plaguing Arsenal is allegations by contractors that they have not been paid for their work. A freelancer who provided editing services to the company took the matter to court and won a judgment against Arsenal, but has yet to receive any payment. CEO Jason Cole insists that the invoice has been paid, but the case remains unresolved, casting doubt on Arsenal's financial practices. Despite these internal problems, Arsenal gained attention for its successful ad campaign for Kim Klacik, a Black Republican running for Congress. The advertisement went viral and raised millions of dollars for Klacik's campaign. However, it was later discovered that Arsenal had an unusual deal with the marketing firm behind the ad, Olympic Media, which was set to receive up to 70 percent of the generated funds. This revelation raised questions about Arsenal's transparency and potential exploitation of their clients. With hopes of replicating the fundraising success with Klacik, Arsenal has taken on more clients with unconventional profiles and long odds. However, the company's consulting contracts include stipulations that grant Arsenal control over the hiring of senior staff and consultants on these campaigns, potentially limiting the autonomy of the candidates they work for. Former employees have also raised concerns about Arsenal's questionable payroll practices. Many claim they were overworked and underpaid, with CEO Jason Cole often resorting to online payment processing apps like PayPal or Venmo instead of using official payroll software. This raises questions about the company's tax compliance and undermines employee confidence in the organization's professionalism. The relationship between Arsenal and its co-founder Benny Johnson has become increasingly murky. Johnson had previously identified himself as a co-founder and chief creative officer of Arsenal. However, he recently distanced himself from the company, leaving employees perplexed about his sudden disassociation. Former employees have alleged that Johnson exhibited bullying behavior and would berate staff if projects did not meet his expectations. Amidst these mounting issues, several employees have chosen to leave Arsenal in recent weeks, further complicating the company's operations. Contractors like Karl Slater are still waiting for payment, adding to the growing skepticism about Arsenal's financial stability. However, despite these challenges, Arsenal continues to hire new staff and attract individuals who are drawn to the company's image and its past success in content production and delivery. As Arsenal Media faces the fallout from its problematic internal environment, questions about transparency, financial stability, and leadership cast doubt on the company's ability to uphold its claims of viral advertising success. The future of Arsenal remains uncertain, with significant challenges ahead that may impact its reputation and ability to secure clients in the Republican political landscape.
