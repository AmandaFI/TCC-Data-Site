Tesla has won a lawsuit relating to the company's Autopilot driver assist software, clearing the technology of responsibility for a 2019 crash. The incident saw a Tesla car turn into a median on a city street while Autopilot was engaged, leading to a lawsuit that was the first of its kind regarding the controversial driver assist software. While the result is not legally binding in other cases, Tesla is under significant pressure over Autopilot and Full Self-Driving, with reports of criminal investigations and regulatory probes into the technology.  . Teslaâ€™s Full Self-Driving beta became available to US customers who purchased the feature in November, but the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) then labelled the technology a "crash risk". Tesla issued a recall for almost 363,000 vehicles that came with Full Self-Driving, which the company reportedly plans to address with an over-the-air software update. Despite the issues and negative press surrounding the technology, Tesla has continued to develop driver assistance technologies and retain strong support from its followers. The recent verdict pertaining to the 2019 crash could help the company in future lawsuits over Autopilot; highlighting that even if the technology is not perfect, it cannot be blamed for every accident that occurs to Tesla drivers. . However, scrutiny around Autopilot and Full Self-Driving continues, with several bodies pursuing investigations. While Tesla has claimed that its vehicles will achieve full self-driving capability through a software update, critics doubt that this is achievable. Furthermore, the California Department of Motor Vehicles have accused Tesla of making false claims about their driver assist technology, and raised concerns around whether Tesla would be able to meet California's regulatory minimums. Overall, the verdict obtained is a positive development for Tesla's Autopilot technology. The company will need to continue to work through the various probes and investigations around its driver assist technologies, amongst concerns relating to road safety and consumer expectations, and will need to ensure a transparent and robust approach to these issues.
