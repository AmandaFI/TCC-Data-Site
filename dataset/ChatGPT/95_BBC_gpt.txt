Kim Jong Un oversees launch of nuclear-capable underwater drone - state media. North Korea has announced that its latest weapon, a nuclear-capable underwater drone, has been successfully tested and is ready for deployment. Dubbed "Haeil" by state media agency KCNA, the drone is capable of creating a "radioactive tsunami" to attack enemy vessels and ports. According to the official statement released by KCNA, the Haeil was detonated on the country's east coast after being placed in the waters off South Hamgyong province for over 59 hours at a depth of 80 to 150 meters. The statement adds that Kim Jong Un personally "guided and observed the test", confirming the importance placed on the weapon's development. Experts have urged caution regarding North Korea's claim of a successful test, highlighting the difficulty of detonating a nuclear device underwater. However, the announcement is sure to increase tensions on the Korean Peninsula, which have remained high in recent months due to North Korea's continued testing of missiles and nuclear weapons. South Korea's president, Moon Jae-in, has vowed to respond to North Korea's provocation, stating that "if North Korea provokes us again, we will make them pay the price for their reckless actions." President Moon's comments came in response to North Korea's firing of several missiles into the Sea of Japan earlier this year, which was seen as a show of force during joint military exercises between the US and South Korea. The latest test comes amid rising tensions between North Korea and the US, with President Donald Trump using strong rhetoric against the country and vowing to stop its nuclear program. The US recently deployed its THAAD anti-missile defense system to South Korea, a move which was met with strong opposition from China. Kim Jong Un's latest weapon is a reminder of North Korea's continued development of dangerous and destabilizing technologies. In recent months, Pyongyang has conducted a series of missile tests and underground nuclear tests, leading to international condemnation and economic sanctions. While the Haeil drone is unlikely to be an immediate threat to US or South Korean forces, it is a reminder that Pyongyang continues to develop new ways to deploy its nuclear weapons. The drone is said to be capable of being launched from a submarine or surface vessel, making it difficult to detect and destroy. The development of the Haeil drone is also a sign that North Korea is seeking to diminish the effectiveness of US missile defense systems, which are designed to intercept missiles in flight. By launching a drone from under the water, Pyongyang could potentially bypass these defenses and deliver a devastating blow to enemy vessels or ports. The announcement of the Haeil drone test is the latest example of North Korea's ongoing efforts to develop its nuclear and missile capabilities. Despite international pressure and economic sanctions, Pyongyang has continued to prioritize its military programs, arguing that they are necessary for the country's self-defense. While it is unclear whether the Haeil drone is as effective as North Korea claims, its development is a reminder of the ongoing risks posed by Pyongyang's nuclear program. The international community will likely continue to pressure North Korea to abandon its weapons programs, but it remains to be seen whether Kim Jong Un will be willing to make such a concession.
