The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has released a report outlining various methods for removing carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere, known as Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR), necessary for limiting global warming. IPCC highlights that most pathways towards limiting global warming to 1.5C or well below 2C will require some CDR. CDR methods include bioenergy with carbon capture and storage, direct air capture, biochar, enhanced rock weathering and ocean alkalinisation. Bioenergy with carbon capture and storage involves CO2 from bioenergy production being captured and stored, while direct air capture involves removing CO2 directly from the air through chemical reactions. Biochar is a process of producing charcoal from organic matter and storing it in soil to enhance carbon sequestration. Enhanced rock weathering involves spreading minerals that react with CO2 on land to enhance carbon sequestration, while ocean alkalinisation involves dissolving calcium compounds in seawater to increase its capacity to absorb CO2. The IPCC report states that CDR technologies offer “multiple benefits” beyond limiting global warming, such as improving air and water quality, restoring degraded land, and providing energy and economic opportunities. However, some scientists are concerned about the feasibility of large-scale CDR and warn that it may provide an excuse for states to avoid making deep emissions cuts. “CDR is a good thing, but it won’t be sufficient on its own to limit global warming. We must reduce greenhouse gas emissions as much as possible, and as fast as possible,” said Glen Peters, Research Director at the Center for International Climate Research in Oslo, Norway. The IPCC report also stated that CDR methods should be implemented alongside emissions reductions and that they must be developed in a way that does not harm biodiversity, land use, water resources, and food security. IPCC urges policymakers to invest in research and development into CDR and to implement policies to encourage its deployment. “We need to see CDR as a complement to emissions reductions, rather than a replacement for them. We need to ensure that its deployment is sustainable and equitable and benefits all nations, including vulnerable communities,” said Pamela McElwee, Professor in the Department of Human Ecology at Rutgers University. CDR is expected to play an increasingly important role in climate policy as countries struggle to meet their emissions reduction targets. Even with ambitious emissions reduction targets, the world will likely exceed its “carbon budget” (the amount of CO2 that can be emitted before the global temperature rises above a certain level) within the next few decades. In this context, CDR is seen as a way to reduce the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere. However, some scientists have warned that relying too heavily on CDR could create a “moral hazard”, where policymakers become complacent about emissions reductions because they believe that CDR can remove the excess emissions. This could result in delayed action on climate change and a greater reliance on unproven technologies. “We must not view CDR as a silver bullet that can solve all our climate problems. It is a tool, but it should not distract us from the urgent need to cut greenhouse gas emissions,” cautioned McElwee. Climate solutions must be implemented in the near term, as the world is currently seeing the worst impact of a warming climate, including rising sea levels, more frequent extreme weather, and loss of biodiversity. Climate efforts must be distributed equally among nations to ensure that we all contribute to creating a safe and sustainable environment for future generations.
