Senegal’s Chargel, a logistics tech startup founded by brothers Moustapha and Alioune Ndoye, has secured $2.5 million in seed funding led by Logos Ventures. The company is digitising the logistics sector by matching shippers with transporters, breaking away from traditional paper-based processes. The platform has already captured the interest of major shipping firms such as Maersk and Grimaldi. Chargel reported a gross merchandise volume of $1.2 million in 2022. With the funding, the company plans to expand its coverage to other francophone African countries. The expansion is in line with growing freight demand within the continent, which is expected to grow by 28% by the end of the decade under the African Continental Free Trade Area agreement. Chargel is set to bridge the gap between shippers and transporters by simplifying the documentation process. The platform eliminates the need for paper-based systems that are usually prone to errors, delays, and lost documents. Before Chargel, shippers had to go through the tedious process of documenting their freight and hope that it will reach their intended destination. With Chargel, shippers can now track their freight in real-time with the use of smartphones and other smart devices. Chargel’s impressive growth caught the attention of venture capitalist (VC) firm Logos Ventures. Ginny Fahs, General Partner at Logos Ventures, spoke about the decision to invest: “We were impressed with Chargel’s breakaway concept, the Ndoye brothers’ background forged in Dakar’s burgeoning tech scene, and their vision for powering the energy of Africa’s logistics network.”. Logos Ventures and other investors are betting on Chargel’s potential to scale up its platform across Africa. The company is positioning itself as a pioneer in the digital transformation of the continent’s logistics sector. The African Continental Free Trade Area agreement, which aims to facilitate the free movement of goods and services across Africa, is a major catalyst for the growth of freight demand in the continent. The agreement will create a single market, boosting intra-African trade and lowering transaction costs. Furthermore, several African countries are investing in infrastructure to support the movement of goods. Examples include the Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) in Kenya, which is expected to reduce the cost of transporting goods by 40%, and the Port of Tema expansion project in Ghana, which aims to make the port a hub for transshipment in West Africa. These developments are happening at a time when the world is experiencing a shortage of shipping capacity due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Consequently, freight rates have surged, resulting in cost escalations for shippers. Countries and regions with greater self-sufficiency in infrastructure, such as Africa, are gradually gaining more leverage in the global supply chain. Chargel’s platform is set to contribute to the improving logistics infrastructure in Africa. The platform ensures that shipments are delivered on time, enabling businesses to operate more efficiently and cost-effectively. Chargel plans to leverage the seed funding to expand its operations in other African countries, starting with those that share the same infrastructure as Senegal. The company’s long-term goal is to establish itself as the logistics platform of choice across Africa. In conclusion, Chargel’s recent seed funding is proof that Africa’s tech landscape is ripe for disruption. The continent is home to enterprising entrepreneurs who are creating innovative solutions to solve the continent’s challenges. With Chargel, shippers no longer have to worry about the tedious process of documentation and tracking. By digitising the logistics sector, Chargel is enabling businesses to operate more efficiently, a direct contributor to the growth of intra-African trade.
