In the competition for talent, technology can help. The "Great Resignation" phenomenon has been making waves in the business world, as employees reevaluate their priorities and opt to leave their jobs in search of greener pastures. A recent study has revealed that a staggering 75% of full-time employees are planning to quit their jobs this year, giving workers newfound power in the job market. With employees demanding higher pay, better benefits, and improved work-life balance, businesses are realizing the need to adapt to these changing times in order to attract and retain top talent. In the race to secure the best employees, technology has emerged as a crucial tool in retaining talent. A prime example can be seen in two companies operating in the same industry. One company has decided to stick to the traditional office setting, while the other has embraced remote or hybrid work. The latter company, in an effort to modernize its network security infrastructure, has implemented a zero trust platform delivered from the cloud, allowing for secure access to resources from any location. This shift towards zero trust network access (ZTNA) has gained traction, especially in the wake of the pandemic. Gartner, a leading research and advisory company, predicts that 70% of new remote access deployments will be served by ZTNA. This technology ensures least-privileged access, reducing the risks associated with virtual private networks (VPNs), which often expose applications to the internet. Zero trust network access operates on the principle of granting access based on identity verification and continuous authentication, rather than trusting users solely based on their location or network connection. This approach significantly enhances network security, protecting businesses from potential cyber threats. However, in order to fully address the challenges brought about by a fully remote workforce, next-generation ZTNA solutions are needed. These advanced platforms incorporate additional security capabilities, such as inline inspection and native app deception, to combat compromised users and mitigate potential risks. Furthermore, extending zero trust to workloads and Internet of Things (IoT) devices provides comprehensive coverage and protection for businesses operating in a digitally connected environment. The right technology architecture plays a vital role in enabling businesses to not only secure their networks but also enhance the user experience. As employees demand flexibility and work-life balance, seamless and efficient remote access to resources becomes imperative. By leveraging cutting-edge technology, businesses can provide their employees with the necessary tools to work remotely without compromising security. Moreover, technology not only aids in retaining talent but also in attracting top-notch employees. In an increasingly competitive job market, skilled individuals are drawn to companies that prioritize modernizing their infrastructure and embracing digital transformation. Businesses that demonstrate a commitment to staying at the forefront of technological advancements are more likely to attract and retain top talent. In conclusion, with the "Great Resignation" phenomenon in full swing, businesses must adapt to the changing expectations and demands of their employees in order to attract and retain top talent. Embracing technology, particularly zero trust network access, can serve as a key differentiating factor for organizations looking to secure their networks, deliver a better user experience, and stand out in a crowded job market. As the digital landscape continues to evolve, companies must stay ahead of the curve and utilize technology to their advantage in the competition for talent.
