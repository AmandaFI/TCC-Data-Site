Meta, the parent company of Facebook, is looking to use generative artificial intelligence (AI) to create ads for businesses by the end of the year. The company has been working on tools that can generate different images and messages for each audience, using machine learning algorithms to identify the preferences and behaviors of targeted consumers. The move is aimed at generating more ad revenue for Meta, which has been struggling with declining revenue growth in recent quarters. Meta's CTO, Andrew Bosworth, said that the generative AI team had been created just a few months ago and has been working tirelessly to develop the technology. The tools are expected to help businesses create more effective ads, and the company hopes they will be embraced by marketers and advertisers looking to improve their campaigns. "Artificial intelligence has the potential to revolutionize the way businesses think about advertising," Bosworth told Nikkei. "Our team has been experimenting with generative AI to create images and messages that resonate with different audiences.". Generative AI is a subset of AI that involves creating algorithms that can generate new content based on patterns and data. It is particularly useful in creating personalized content for audiences, such as ads that are tailored to the interests and behaviors of individual consumers. Other companies, such as Omneky and Movio, have been exploring the use of generative AI in advertising and marketing videos. According to a recent report by eMarketer, ad spending in the US is expected to reach $271 billion in 2021, up from $233 billion in 2020. However, the report notes that growth in digital advertising has slowed in recent years, with Facebook's ad revenue growth slowing to 22% in the first quarter of 2021, down from 46% the previous year. This has led Meta to explore new avenues for generating revenue, including the use of generative AI to improve its ad offerings. The company is also investing heavily in its metaverse, a virtual world that it hopes will become the next big thing in social media and entertainment. The metaverse is expected to generate its own revenue streams through virtual goods, advertising, and other revenue-generating opportunities. Meta is betting big on the potential of the metaverse, with CEO Mark Zuckerberg saying that it could become the "next generation of the internet.". However, some analysts have expressed skepticism about Meta's ability to generate significant revenue from the metaverse, noting that the technology is still in its early stages and that there are many hurdles to overcome before it can become a viable business opportunity. In the meantime, Meta is pursuing other avenues for generating revenue, including improvements to its ad offerings through the use of generative AI. The technology has the potential to create more effective and personalized ads, which could attract more businesses to the platform and drive up revenue growth. Meta has not yet announced specific details about its generative AI tools or how they will be implemented, but the company has made it clear that advertising is a top priority as it looks to boost revenue and fend off competition from other social media platforms. With the use of generative AI, Meta hopes to create ads that are more effective, personalized, and engaging for consumers. The technology has the potential to revolutionize the way businesses think about advertising, and Meta is betting that it can help drive revenue growth in the coming years.
