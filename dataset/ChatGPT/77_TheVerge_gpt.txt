Samsung's Having a Terrible Financial Year. Samsung Electronics has estimated a 96% decrease in its quarterly operating profit compared to the same period last year. This is the worst that the company has experienced and it's largely attributed to a plummet in chip demand globally. The semiconductor demand was particularly hit by the lockdown measures, with the global economic slowdown causing consumers to rethink purchasing new products. Despite the decrease, Samsung still made a profit of $456m in operating profits. However, this is a significant reduction in profit compared to the $10.7bn the company generated last year. Therefore, Samsung is cutting memory chip production to balance out the oversupply. The situation has been aggravated by increasing competition, such as Broadcom, which reported better-than-expected results for the quarter. This indicates that Samsung's rivals are responding better to the market's changing needs. Sales of the new Galaxy S23 series reached around 11 million units, showing that the flagship phone is still a popular choice. However, it was not enough to make up for the company's losses in chip sales. Samsung's display business also suffered due to the decrease in smartphone production, which led to the company being unable to meet the demand from customers, as well as being unable to fully operate its factories when customers reduced orders. Going forward, Samsung could experience further misfortunes if the demand for chips doesn't pick up soon, as the company is heavily reliant on this product to fuel its profits. Therefore, Samsung's higher-ups are reportedly taking a more cautious approach to the next quarter. This news may come as a surprise to some consumers who have used the company's products and rely on them for their daily routine. Nevertheless, the downsizing of production and minimising oversupply is seen as a sensible move considering the situation. As the world economy changes and competition increases, businesses must take note and adapt to the new requirements. Samsung appears to be taking this on board and the company's strategy for 2021 and beyond could look vastly different from what they have been used to in the past.
