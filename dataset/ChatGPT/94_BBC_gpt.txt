Terry Gou, the founder of Foxconn, a major supplier for Apple, is making a fresh bid for the presidential nomination in Taiwan, aiming to be nominated by Taiwan's main opposition party, the Kuomintang (KMT). This is the second time Gou will pursue the presidency after failing to be nominated in 2019. If he successfully secures the party's nomination, he is expected to take a more China-friendly approach than the current administration. Gou, who stepped down from his position as Foxconn's boss in 2019 to pursue the presidency candidacy, is warning young people that voting for Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive Party is dangerous. The party supports Taiwan independence, a move discouraged by China, which sees Taiwan as a self-ruled breakaway province. Gou believes that the only way to avoid war with China is to lessen tensions between Washington and Beijing. The KMT party traditionally leans towards having closer ties with China than the current administration, which is known for adopting a cautious approach when it comes to its dealings with Beijing. If Gou secures the nomination, it would be a critical development in Taiwan's politics, especially given his prior association with Foxconn. The technology behemoth has strong ties with China and has been involved in several controversies, including worker exploitation allegations and fatal factory accidents. Despite these controversies, Gou is still seen as one of the most successful Taiwanese business entrepreneurs. His success in the technology industry has propelled him into an influential position, making him a leading figure in the country's political scene. He is also expected to be a strong rival for the current president, Tsai Ing-wen, who was re-elected in a landslide victory in January 2020. Gou's announcement of his presidential bid comes at a critical time in Taiwan's history. With China increasingly asserting itself in the region, Taiwan remains the most significant flashpoint of tension between Beijing and Washington. The current administration in Taiwan has been attempting to strengthen its global presence, but Gou's candidacy suggests a shift away from this approach if he secured the nomination. Despite the challenges facing Taiwan and the complicated history between Taiwan, China, and the US, Gou is optimistic about the future. In a recent statement, he said, "I am confident or else I would have stuck to business. I believe that I can use my experience to help Taiwan, and I feel that Taiwan needs me." . Gou's candidacy for the Taiwan presidency highlights a delicate diplomatic situation in the region. As the country prepares for its presidential election in 2024, Gou's China-friendly approach and business reputation could prove a winning combination. However, it remains to be seen whether the KMT party, in its desperate bid to win the presidency, will side with Gou.
