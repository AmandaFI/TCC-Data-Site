Artificial intelligence (AI) powered assistants have become commonplace in many homes and offices and now two new startups are looking to bring them to e-commerce. Singaporean firm Mindverse AI has developed an application programming interface (API) that will allow companies to create smart agents based on GPT series language models from OpenAI. Mindverse’s ChatGPT-like AI agents will enable effortless communication between companies and customers, providing a new level of personalisation and service. The company raised $7m in its last round of funding and is set to conclude a $10m Series A funding round soon, with Sequoia China, Linear Capital, K2 Venture, Yinxinggu Capital and Plug and Play investing in the company. Andreessen Horowitz-backed Cider is one of the early adopters of Mindverse AI’s technology. The fashion startup is using its smart agents to personalise the shopping experience and capture more detailed data on customer preferences. The system allows shoppers to communicate with the website naturally, as if they were conversing with an in-store salesperson. The customer can ask questions, seek advice and receive product recommendations as if they were in the store with the salesperson. It’s hoped the technology will improve customer engagement and sales. “Mindverse AI is enabling us to deliver a shopping experience that is both smart and human,” said Alex Cohen, co-founder of Cider. “The ability to use GPTs enables us to communicate with customers who have different language preferences and allows their intent to be understood.”. Another startup, Hooked, has already adopted Mindverse AI’s technology for its education platform. The learning app helps students boost their writing skills with the help of AI coaches. The smart agents offer support and advice every step of the way, from brainstorming and outlining to the creation of a first draft. The system will help teachers provide individualised support to their students while allowing them to take on a more facilitative and interactive role. “These smart agents are helping to improve the outcomes for students and teachers alike,” said Dr. Enoch Tan, CEO of Hooked. “We are excited about the possibilities that this technology is bringing to the education space.”. Alibaba, one of the world’s largest e-commerce platforms, is also exploring the use of AI assistants for its marketplace. The company has developed an AI-based brand search feature that helps shoppers find the products they want by recognising images or logos. The system will improve the accuracy of search results, making it easier for customers to find exactly what they are looking for. . The new feature leverages advanced computer vision technology to help shoppers search for products by turning pictures of the desired brand into a search engine query. The system is designed to recognise brands from a wide range of industries, including fashion, beauty, and electronics. “With the new feature, we want to simplify the search process for shoppers and offer a more direct path to the product they want,” said Zhang Zhirong, research scientist at Alibaba. The move is part of Alibaba’s ongoing efforts to experiment with AI and improve the e-commerce experience for its customers. The company has been a key investor in AI over the past few years, developing a range of cutting-edge technologies including facial recognition payment systems and AI-powered voice assistants. . The developments in AI assistants are set to change the way people shop online, with personalised experiences and support making it easier for them to find what they want. The ability to communicate naturally and easily with brands is already transforming the way companies interact with their customers, and the possibilities for using AI to improve other sectors of life are virtually limitless.
