BMW, the German automaker, has expanded its Digital Key Plus feature to select Android phones running on Android 13.1 or later. The move allows for more smartphone users to remotely lock/unlock their car and start the engine without the need for a physical key. The company first launched its mobile car key technology last year, but it only supported iPhones with U1 chips. Now, BMW is taking advantage of the ultra-wideband (UWB) digital radio technology found in some Android devices, including the Google Pixel 7 Pro and Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4, to extend the compatibility of its Digital Key Plus. The system uses near-field communication (NFC) and Bluetooth LE, and UWB technology, to allow BMW drivers to replace their physical car key with their smartphone. The feature is part of the My BMW smartphone app, which can display the car's battery level, fuel level, and a vehicle status checker. In addition, users can also share access to their vehicle with up to five other people who have a supported Android or iOS phone. This defeats the need for a physical key being passed between drivers and passengers. The Digital Key Plus is currently only available for BMW vehicles produced from November 2022, but BMW has plans to expand support to older compatible vehicles through future software updates. To use the feature, Android users will need to download the My BMW app and ensure that their device is running Android 13.1 or later. Samsung devices will also need the Samsung Wallet app installed on their phone. Ken Colborn, Product Manager of BMW Digital Key said, "with this expansion to Android, we're thrilled to bring the convenience of Digital Key Plus to even more drivers. We know our customers choose BMW for its performance, technology and luxurious design, and these new features add even more to the driving experience". The move by BMW is part of an industry-wide push to introduce flexible, mobile solutions for car owners. In the future, it should become more commonplace for users to remotely manage home and car automation, smart homes, and other connected devices through a single app.  The BMW Digital Key Plus feature, combined with the My BMW app, brings this type of connectivity to the vehicle itself.
