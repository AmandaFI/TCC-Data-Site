Netflix's ad-supported plan, launched last November, is getting an upgrade. Users in 10 markets, including Canada and Spain, will now be able to enjoy the streaming service in 1080p resolution with two concurrent streams. The improvements will be rolled out in the US this month. The ad-supported plan, priced at $6.99 per month, is proving popular and is earning more average revenue per membership than the standard plan, which costs $15.99 per month. The company expects ad revenues to reach $1.9 billion in 2024, up from an estimated $770 million this year. The improvements to the ad-supported plan come as Netflix faces increased competition from other streaming services, such as Disney+ and HBO Max. The company is also seeking to address another issue, password sharing, which it has been attempting to tackle for a while. Netflix currently allows people to share their passwords with others, although it does limit the number of devices that can access the service simultaneously. However, the company is now planning to roll out restrictions on password sharing more broadly this summer. The move is likely to be unpopular with some users, who have come to rely on sharing passwords as a way to save money. However, Netflix believes that password sharing is costing the company significant revenue, as people are able to access the service without paying for it. Some analysts have suggested that Netflix's focus on ads and password sharing restrictions may be a sign that the company is struggling to maintain its subscriber growth and revenue. However, others argue that the company is simply adapting to changing market conditions and trying to stay ahead of its competitors. One thing is clear â€“ the streaming market is becoming increasingly crowded, and companies need to keep innovating in order to stay ahead. With its latest upgrades, Netflix is showing that it is willing to do just that.
