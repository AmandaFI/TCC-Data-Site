Snap's parent company, Snap, has unveiled new initiatives aimed at revolutionizing online shopping using augmented reality (AR) technology. The company announced the introduction of a new in-app destination called "Dress Up" within Snapchat, which will feature AR fashion and virtual try-on experiences. Additionally, Snap is launching tools that will allow retailers to integrate with Snapchat's AR shopping technology on their own websites and apps. Over the past year, Snap has been working on improving its AR-powered e-commerce capabilities. The company has integrated its computer vision-based "Scan" feature into the Camera section of the Snapchat app and enhanced it with commerce capabilities. Real-time pricing and product details have also been added to enhance AR shopping listings, resulting in increased engagement from consumers. Since January 2021, over 5 billion engagements with AR shopping lenses have been recorded by Snapchat users, with more than 250 million participants. Snap's latest innovation is the launch of Camera Kit for AR Shopping, an AR software development kit (SDK) that allows retailers to integrate Snap's AR try-on technology into their own mobile apps and websites. With this SDK, retailers can incorporate catalog-powered shopping lenses into their product pages, enabling customers to virtually try on clothing, accessories, shoes, and more. Puma is the first global partner to utilize this technology, allowing shoppers to try on sneakers simply by pointing their phone at their feet. In addition to the SDK, retailers will have access to Snap's AR Image Processing technology in its 3D asset manager. This feature streamlines the process of creating AR shopping experiences, making it faster and more user-friendly. Brands will be able to select their product SKUs and convert them into shopping lenses through a web interface. By uploading their existing product photography, Snap's technology will use AI to process the images and generate AR assets. These assets can then be used to create new try-on lenses for shoppers, enhancing the overall shopping experience. Snap is also focusing on enhancing AR shopping within its own app for consumers. Snapchat will introduce the "Dress Up" feature, where users can discover and browse new try-on experiences from creators, retailers, and fashion brands. Consumers will have the option to navigate to a shopping section within their profile, where they can view favorited items, recently accessed products, and items added to their cart. Furthermore, Snap revealed that Zenni Optical's AR lenses have been tried on over 60 million times by users. Lenses incorporating Snap's "true size" technology have shown a 42% higher return on ad spend compared to lenses without the feature. Snap's Bitmoji is also receiving an update. With over 1 billion mini avatars created to date, Snap is now allowing fashion brand partners to release "Limited Edition" fashion items exclusively for Bitmoji on Snapchat. This update will provide users with unique and exclusive fashion items while further enhancing the partnership between Snap and fashion brands. Snap's new AR tools and initiatives aim to revolutionize the online shopping experience by incorporating AR technology into the process. With the introduction of Camera Kit for AR Shopping, retailers can now integrate Snap's AR try-on technology into their own platforms, allowing customers to virtually try on products before making a purchase. Additionally, Snap's AR Image Processing technology makes it faster and simpler for brands to create AR shopping experiences. With these advancements, Snap is poised to transform how consumers shop online and further solidify its position as a leader in augmented reality technology.
