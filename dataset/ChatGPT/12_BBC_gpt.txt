Mayor starts legal bid over false bribery claim. The Mayor of Hepburn Shire Council in Australia, Brian Hood, has initiated legal action against OpenAI, the creator of advanced chatbot ChatGPT, over false information shared by the tool. OpenAI, which was acquired by Microsoft in 2023, added ChatGPT to Bing in February of the same year. Since the chatbot's launch in November 2022, millions of people have used it to generate content on a wide variety of topics. However, Hood alleges that ChatGPT generated false information about him that has damaged his reputation. The chatbot claimed that the mayor had been imprisoned for bribery while working for a subsidiary of Australia's national bank. In fact, Hood was a whistleblower who sought to expose corruption within the bank. He was never charged with a crime, and the false information generated by ChatGPT has caused him considerable distress and reputational harm. Hood has sent a concerns notice to OpenAI, the first formal step in defamation action in Australia. This gives the company 28 days to respond. If they do not, the mayor will be able to take the company to court under Australian law. This would be the first time OpenAI has faced a defamation suit over the content generated by ChatGPT, which has previously been criticized for producing inaccurate or nonsensical answers. While OpenAI includes a disclaimer warning users that the content generated by ChatGPT may contain inaccurate information, Hood and his legal team argue that this does not absolve the company of responsibility for false and damaging claims. In a statement, Hood said: "I have been deeply hurt by the false claims made by ChatGPT. This tool is designed to generate content based on complex algorithms and machine learning, but it should not be allowed to spread false and damaging information about individuals. "I hope that OpenAI will take my concerns seriously and work with me to correct the false information generated by ChatGPT. If they do not, I will take whatever steps I need to protect my reputation and ensure that this does not happen to anyone else.". The legal action against OpenAI has raised important questions about the potential risks of advanced artificial intelligence tools like ChatGPT. While these tools offer exciting new possibilities for generating content and solving complex problems, they also bring significant ethical and legal challenges. In particular, there is a concern that advanced AI tools may perpetuate or amplify existing biases and stereotypes, as well as generating false or misleading information. As AI technologies continue to develop and become more pervasive, it will become increasingly important to address these challenges and ensure that the benefits of technology are balanced against its potential risks. For his part, Mayor Hood hopes that his legal action will make technology companies more accountable for the content they generate. He said: "I believe that we need to start having serious conversations about the role of AI in our lives and the responsibilities that come with developing and deploying these tools. "I am taking a stand not just for my own reputation, but for the broader principle that we should not allow technology to cause harm or spread false information. I hope that my case will send a strong message to the tech industry that they cannot duck their responsibilities in this area.".
