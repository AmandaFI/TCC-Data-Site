Real estate developer turned prefab home builder Veev has successfully raised $400 million in a Series D funding round. The funding was led by Bond and included participation from LenX (formerly Lennar Ventures), Zeev Ventures, Fifth Wall Climate Tech, and JLL Spark Global Ventures. This latest round brings Veev's total raised to $600 million since its inception in 2008. Veev aims to address the housing crisis in the US, particularly in California where there is an estimated deficit of 3 million housing units. The company claims to have developed a system that is four times faster than traditional means, at a lower cost, and with a smaller carbon footprint. This has garnered interest from investors as Veev's innovative approach has the potential to revolutionize the homebuilding industry. Founded as a traditional real estate developer and asset manager, Veev Group began focusing on prefabrication capabilities in 2017. It formally pivoted to a vertically integrated developer focused on building innovation in 2018. The company developed a proprietary panelized building system that utilizes materials such as steel frames, high-performance acrylic finishes, and smart sensors. These materials contribute to a significantly reduced carbon footprint compared to traditional construction methods. Veev utilizes a digital fabrication process to design and produce new homes, which are then manufactured at its 50,000-square-foot facility called the "Digital Fab." The company's panelized system offers greater flexibility in terms of design and site location compared to volumetric factory-built housing. This allows Veev to customize its homes to meet the specific needs and preferences of its customers. With the new funding, Veev plans to scale its operations, expand construction and distribution to new markets, and accelerate research and development initiatives. The company also sets a goal to further reduce its homes' carbon footprint by an additional 25% in 2022. Veev's choice of materials, such as Light Gauge Steel framing and High-Performance Surface, already result in 47% less CO2e emissions than traditional construction materials. By continuously improving its processes and materials, Veev aims to lead the industry in creating sustainable and eco-friendly homes. Veev expects to achieve profitability within two years and projects a significant increase in production in 2022 compared to 2021. The company plans to replicate its Digital Fab facility near regions of demand, allowing it to build homes faster and avoid unnecessary transportation costs. This expansion is crucial in meeting the housing needs of a growing population. Noah Knauf, general partner at Bond, expressed his excitement about Veev's innovative approach to building homes. He described Veev's software-defined, end-to-end manufacturing process as revolutionary. This sentiment is echoed by the emergence of other tech-enabled homebuilders in recent years, including 3D-printing homebuilder ICON and "next gen" homebuilder Homebound. Despite the challenges faced by the construction tech industry, such as the demise of SoftBank-backed startup Katerra, Veev remains optimistic about its future. The company believes it has taken a different approach to scaling its business and is poised to make a significant impact on the housing crisis in the US. With its strong financial backing and dedication to sustainable and efficient homebuilding, Veev is well-positioned to transform the industry and provide much-needed housing solutions. As the company continues to innovate and expand, it offers hope for a brighter future in the face of the ongoing housing crisis.
