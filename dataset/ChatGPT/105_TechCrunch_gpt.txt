Volvo Cars Tech Fund has invested in Israeli startup CorrActions' driver monitoring system, enabling micro muscle movements to understand a driver's cognitive state. The technology uses sensors already built into cars to evaluate brain activity and detect whether drivers are intoxicated, tired, or distracted. CorrActions has already partnered with fleet managers and OEMs, with plans to expand the technology to monitor the motion sickness levels of passengers. The funding will be used to support the ongoing development and commercialisation of the product. CorrActions is also exploring how the technology can improve driver safety by detecting cognitive impairments. The driver monitoring technology developed by CorrActions offers a step forward in improving road safety. The startup's technology uses a combination of sensors already embedded in cars to evaluate brain activity and detect changes that indicate driver impairment. The system observes micro muscle movements to assess whether a driver is tired, distracted, or intoxicated. CorrActions already works with fleet managers and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and is exploring how its technology could be used to monitor motion sickness levels of passengers. The technology uses an algorithm that measures the amount of head movement relative to body movement, which can provide an early indication of a passengerâ€™s discomfort. The funding from Volvo Cars Tech Fund is expected to accelerate the commercialisation of the technology, with a particular focus on improving driver safety. The startup will continue to develop its driver monitoring system, with the intention of rolling it out more broadly. The funding will also help to establish better relationships with car manufacturers and commercial consumers. CorrActions' driver monitoring system has been met with positive feedback during in-vehicle testing. Early testing has shown the technology is highly accurate, with the system being able to detect tired or distracted driving with a high level of accuracy. The startup is also exploring how the technology can improve driver safety by detecting cognitive impairments. CorrActions has a history of working with car manufacturers, with a previous proof of concept project being developed with Volkswagen. The company has been a pioneer in the field of driver monitoring technology, continually pushing the boundaries of what is currently possible. The technology has significant potential to reduce the number of accidents caused by driver impairment. In conclusion, the Volvo Cars Tech Fund has invested in driver monitoring technology developed by CorrActions, which promises to improve driver safety by detecting impairments. The technology uses sensors already built into cars to evaluate brain activity and detect whether a driver is tired, distracted, or intoxicated. The startup has already partnered with fleet managers and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), with the aim of expanding the technology to passenger motion sickness. The funding from Volvo Cars Tech Fund will help to accelerate the commercialisation of the technology, ultimately contributing to safer roads for all.
