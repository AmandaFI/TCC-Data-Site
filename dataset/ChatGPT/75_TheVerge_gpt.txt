Operation Cookie Monster Shuts Off Hacker Marketplace Selling Millions of Stolen Accounts. In a triumphant operation that has taken down one of the world’s largest black markets for stolen accounts, law enforcement agencies on both sides of the Atlantic have shut down Genesis Market, a website that sold access to more than 80 million account access credentials. The website was described by one expert as “the eBay of account credentials”, where hackers could search for specific types of credentials and credentials from certain countries, allowing them to commit an array of fraudulent activities. The takedown of Genesis Market was the result of an investigation that spanned more than two years and involved a range of law enforcement agencies, including the FBI, Dutch police and Europol. In total, 119 users of the marketplace, who had sold or purchased stolen credentials, have been arrested and several websites that were associated with the marketplace have been seized. Authorities have hailed the operation as a significant victory in the fight against cyber-crime. Stéphane Nappo of Société Générale CIB said: “Taking down one of the largest criminal marketplaces in this way has sent a clear message to those involved in illegal activity that they are within the reach of the law.”. Genesis Market was one of the largest marketplaces for stolen data on the dark web, with customers from all over the world. A Europol statement revealed that the website sold login information for all kinds of online services, and that the site had been operational since 2017. The stolen data that was on offer included everything from session tokens, cookies, and browser fingerprints, which could all be used to gain access to users’ online accounts. Genesis stole fingerprints too and provided a browser extension that let hackers spoof the victim's fingerprint while using their login cookie to access the account. In some cases, hackers were able to use this extension to bypass two-factor authentication (2FA) measures, which might otherwise have provided some defence against attacks. Although the takedown of Genesis Market is a significant win in the fight against cybercrime, it is unknown how many other similar marketplaces exist on the dark web, or how much data exists on the dark web as a whole. It is believed that there could still be many more data breaches that have yet to be discovered, which may have been caused by the use of weak passwords, lack of security education, or vulnerabilities in software. Law enforcement agencies have advised the public that they can check if their login credentials were stolen by using the HaveIBeenPwned.com service. If data was found to be stolen by malware, the FBI and Dutch police recommend logging out of all accounts on every web browser on the computer, clearing cookies and caches, running a virus scan or resetting the computer before logging back in. The takedown of Genesis Market is just one example of the increasing efforts being taken by law enforcement agencies to fight cybercrime. In recent years, there has been a growing emphasis on collaboration between agencies and the sharing of information in order to improve the effectiveness of investigations. Europol, which was closely involved in the Genesis operation, has indicated that it expects similar results in future crackdowns on cybercrime. Speaking on the day of the operation, Europol's Executive Director, Catherine De Bolle, said: "This operation shows that anonymity on the internet is not guaranteed and that criminals cannot escape law enforcement authorities, even if they operate from a different jurisdiction.". The success of Operation Cookie Monster is a reminder to businesses and individuals alike of the importance of online security measures. To stay safe online, experts recommend the use of strong passwords, the implementation of multi-factor authentication methods wherever possible, and regular software updates and security patches. By taking such precautions, users can help to minimise the risk of their data being stolen and sold to cybercriminals.
