Flintshire council is considering the installation of CCTV cameras with number plate recognition to address the issues of dangerous parking outside schools. This move comes following a report conducted jointly by the council's environment and education scrutiny committees, which highlighted the challenge faced in resolving such problems, especially where schools are located on narrow roads or in densely populated areas. Flintshire is home to 78 schools, and at present, 25 have some form of traffic restrictions in place. These range from "School Keep Clear" markings to other measures to manage parking around school pick-up and drop-off times. The council has suggested the use of CCTV cameras as an effective deterrent to parents and carers who park in prohibited areas. The technology will capture the number plates of offending vehicles, which will then be used to issue penalty notices. This move is expected to significantly improve road safety and reduce the number of accidents caused by vehicles parking inappropriately. The proposal is scheduled to be discussed at a meeting of the council on Thursday, where further details surrounding implementation and funding will be discussed. The council will also be seeking feedback from parents, schools and local residents on the use of CCTV in school areas. The use of CCTV in school areas has been successfully implemented across other regions in the UK, such as London and Manchester, where similar issues around road safety and parking have been addressed. The system has been recognised as a cost-effective and efficient approach to reducing instances of dangerous parking and promoting road safety. A spokesperson for the council commented: "We need to make sure that we do everything we can to ensure the safety of children walking to and from school, and this includes addressing the issue of dangerous parking. We believe that the use of CCTV with number plate recognition will be an effective solution to tackling this problem and we look forward to discussing the proposal at the upcoming meeting.". In addition to the use of CCTV, the council has also encouraged parents and carers to follow guidelines around safe parking practices. This includes encouraging parents to park in designated areas or use alternative modes of transport, such as walking or cycling, to reduce the amount of traffic around school areas during peak periods.
