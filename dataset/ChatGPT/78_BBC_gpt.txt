Chinese President Xi Jinping arrived in Russia on Friday, marking his first official visit to the country since the Ukraine crisis began. Xi aims to sign a strategic partnership with President Vladimir Putin, reaffirming China's support for Russia during a challenging time of global isolation. The energy sector will be a key topic on the agenda, as well as exploring military cooperation. Despite China’s purported support of Russia, sources suggest that Xi may be limited in his backing due to China’s primary focus on its economic agenda and reinforcing its own global role. The Chinese president's visit is highly significant given that it comes amid growing international tensions over Russia's intervention in Ukraine. The visit is seen as a show of support for Putin’s demands for a multipolar global system, something that has been one of Xi's key goals. This is especially true given the fact that the United States, the European Union (EU), and other western nations have imposed a series of economic sanctions on Russia in response to its annexation of Crimea and its role in the conflict in eastern Ukraine.  This has led to Moscow turning to China to boost the Russian economy’s fortunes. Speaking ahead of the meeting, Putin said that the two nations had an important and strategic relationship, and that it was developing "with good pace." Putin added that his relationship with Xi was at the highest level in history and the partnership was leading to a "qualitative" improvement in relations. The visit is expected to expand on previous agreements between the two nations, including a $100 billion pipeline deal, and a joint naval exercise. The energy sector is expected to be key to the discussions, with both leaders attempting to finalize a natural gas supply contract that has been under negotiation for years. The deal, dubbed the “Power of Siberia 2” project, would see Russia supply China with gas for 30 years and generate approximately $455 billion in revenue for the gas company Gazprom. The two nations will also discuss developing other parts of the Russian energy sector, including coal and oil. However, it is important to note that despite the strong signs of support, Xi may be reluctant to fully support Putin's policies. Analysts have suggested that China’s true priority is to focus on its own economic growth and development as well as enhancing its own global role as a superpower. As such, it would not be surprising if Xi avoids publicly supporting Putin’s policies to avoid negative effects on China’s international relations. Speaking at the Eastern Economic Forum earlier in the week, Putin stated, “I’d like to emphasize the high level of Russian-Chinese relations today. We have reached unprecedented close and trusting relations both at the inter-governmental level and as personal contacts.". Xi's trip comes at a time when China is trying to create a “New Silk Road”, connecting it to Europe through a trading route based on ancient models of trade. This will enable China to expand its influence on the surrounding regions while also mitigating the effects of the west's sanctions against Russia. Additionally, with Russia looking to increase its global support, having China on its side could help bolster its international influence. Military cooperation is also expected to be discussed during the talks. Putin and Xi are expected to finalize on the sale of Russian S-400 air defense missile systems to China. Additionally, it is likely that the countries will discuss expanding their military cooperation and may look into joint exercises. However, Putin has previously said that China and Russia are not forming a military bloc and that their strategic partnership does not infringe upon the interests of other nations. The relationship between Russia and China has been rapidly strengthening over the last 10 years since Putin became President. During that time, both countries have worked to strengthen their economic, political, and military ties. While the two leaders have vastly different governing philosophies, the relationship has been built on mutual respect and support for each other's interests. One issue that may cause some tension between the two nations is their stance on the Ukraine conflict. China has thus far remained neutral on the matter, but Russia will be keen to receive any degree of support that it can from Beijing. Some analysts suggest that China will not support Russia at the expense of international relations, as damaging global relations could have adverse effects on China's economic growth and influence. Other commentators suggest that the two superpowers will work to form a strategic alliance that will be a formidable force in the shaping of global policies. This meeting between Xi and Putin is likely to cement the strong relationship between the two nations, with both leaders keen to stress the importance of their strategic partnership. While the meeting will likely focus on specific issues relating to trade, military partnerships, and energy, it could also provide the opportunity to address some of the wider geopolitical issues that are shaping the current global stage. Ultimately it remains to be seen whether China will support Russia in its ambitious geopolitical agenda. However, what is clear is that China and Russia have a strategic partnership that is growing in strength, and it is one that will undoubtedly shape global policies over the coming years.
