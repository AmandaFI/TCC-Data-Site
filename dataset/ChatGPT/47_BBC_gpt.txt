North Korea claims to have successfully tested a new solid-fuel intercontinental ballistic missile that is its most powerful missile to date. This announcement has sparked widespread condemnation from the Japanese, South Korean and US authorities, as well as concerns of regional instability. According to reports, the test was conducted in a remote area in North Korea's northwest, where the missile blasted off from a mobile launcher. North Korean leader, Kim Jong Un, reportedly gave the order for the military to "adopt a more practical and offensive" manner in war deterrence just days before the test. The development of a solid-fuel intercontinental ballistic missile is a significant breakthrough in North Korea's weapons programme. Solid-fuel missiles are quickly fuelled and require far less warning than their liquid-fuel counterparts, enabling strike capability on shorter notice. This means that the threat of a nuclear attack from North Korea has significantly increased. South Korea's defence ministry has claimed that North Korea will still need more time before a fully operational solid-fuel ICBM system can be developed. However, the fact that North Korea has claimed to have tested its most powerful missile yet has sent waves of concern across the region. Japan's Hokkaido island delayed the start times of schools as a precautionary measure, while some train services were suspended. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has condemned the launch and called for an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council. In response, South Korea conducted a series of military drills to test its readiness to respond to potential North Korean aggression. The drills involved the testing of an advanced air-to-ground missile, which could be used to target North Korean facilities. The United States has also strongly condemned the missile test, with President Donald Trump calling it "reckless and dangerous". The US has already imposed a raft of economic sanctions on North Korea, and it is yet to be seen whether further action will be taken in response to the latest missile test. The US has deployed its Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile defence system in South Korea, which is designed to intercept and destroy incoming ballistic missile threats. Early analysis of the missile test has suggested that the new missile is capable of reaching the US mainland. The missile reached an altitude of more than 4,475 km and travelled a horizontal distance of around 1,000 km, before landing in the Sea of Japan. The test has also raised concerns that North Korea may seek to sell its missile technology to other countries or rogue groups, potentially destabilising the region and beyond. The timing of the missile test is significant as it comes just ahead of Trump's scheduled visit to Asia. The visit is expected to focus heavily on North Korea's nuclear programme and could lead to further tensions and instability in the region. While there have been previous missile tests conducted by North Korea in recent months, this latest test is the most powerful and significant. It suggests that North Korea is continuing to develop its nuclear capabilities and will not be deterred by economic sanctions or threats from other nations. The international community is now calling for further action to be taken to de-escalate tensions and to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons. The missile test has added to the already complex and unpredictable situation in the region, and it remains to be seen how the United States, South Korea, Japan and other nations will respond to this latest provocation from North Korea.
