Blood Tests May Spare Cancer Patients Chemo. A new blood test is being trialled in the UK which could detect residual cancer after surgery and spare thousands of bowel cancer patients unnecessary chemotherapy. Developed by US company Guardant Health, the test examines the bloodstream for microscopic traces of cancer known as circulating tumour DNA. Half of patients with stage-three bowel cancer are cured by surgery alone, but some go on to receive chemotherapy which can cause nerve damage. The blood test will aim to identify those who do not require chemotherapy. The trial will take place over three years with survival rates compared between the blood test and standard chemotherapy groups. Similar trials are also being conducted for lung and breast cancers. Joanne was one of the first patients to undergo the trial. She was diagnosed with Stage 3 bowel cancer in 2017 and underwent surgery to remove a section of her bowel, followed by chemotherapy. “The chemo was horrible, I couldn’t feel my hands or feet, I had a metallic taste in my mouth and my hair fell out,” she said. “I needed to have it, but boy was it hard.”. Joanne’s oncologist, Dr. Elaine Smyth, said the blood test for circulating tumour DNA could help avoid chemotherapy for some patients. “We do sometimes worry about the cumulative toxicity of chemotherapy, that’s the nerve pain, and that can be permanent in some patients," she said. “We have had good results in Spain, where tests showed 50% of patients after surgery didn’t need chemotherapy.”. The test works by detecting genetic material from a patient’s tumour circulating in their blood. If the test is positive then the patient is given chemotherapy. If the test shows no remaining cancer cells then the patient is closely monitored to ensure it does not return. While the tests are not yet available in the UK, they have been available in the US for three years. The trial is funded by Cancer Research UK, with additional funding from the National Institute for Health Research Cancer and Frontier Science. Dr. David Gonzalez de Castro, consultant medical oncologist at the Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, welcomed the research, stating: “This exciting development has the potential to revolutionise decision making in adjuvant chemotherapy and avoid unnecessary treatment with all its associated toxicities and financial consequences.”. The results of the trial will be eagerly awaited, as this new development has the potential to not only reduce the physical side effects of chemotherapy, but also the economic impact on the NHS of unnecessary treatment.
