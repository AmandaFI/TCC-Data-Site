SiriusXM, the parent company of Pandora and Stitcher, has developed a new way to track and identify its listening audience across its various apps. The solution, called "AudioID," is powered by AdsWizz, a digital audio adtech company that Pandora acquired in 2018. With the decline in the use of tracking cookies and Apple's anti-tracking privacy update affecting mobile app advertising revenues, the adtech industry has been searching for innovative solutions. SiriusXM's AudioID aims to address this challenge by matching user information across its businesses, creating a single identifier for each customer. By analyzing data sets for overlapping signals, such as matching email addresses, SiriusXM can generate a unique but anonymized "AudioID" for each user. This identifier spans across streaming apps, including its satellite radio music service, Pandora, and podcast app Stitcher. Unlike traditional tracking methods, users are not asked for additional information or required to give consent. Furthermore, there is currently no opt-out option available. SiriusXM emphasizes that AudioIDs are privacy-conscious and designed to obfuscate personal information while enabling advertisers to target users with relevant ads. At launch, AudioID supports first-party ad targeting, measurement, forecasting, and frequency capping. Chris Record, Senior Vice President of AdsWizz, describes AudioID as a consumer-first infrastructure that prioritizes privacy and enhances user experiences while providing marketers with data-driven capabilities. However, it remains to be seen whether consumers will appreciate this solution, given their previous experiences with highly targeted ads after opting out of tracking. While marketers argue that personalized ads are welcomed because of their relevancy, some consumers opt out to protect their personal information and find personalized ads too intrusive. Unfortunately, the AudioID solution does not directly address these concerns. SiriusXM acknowledges that AudioID is currently an opt-in solution available for its partners and marketers. However, the company plans to extend first-party targeting to off-platform marketers and advertisers in 2022. This expansion could potentially provide a more comprehensive and targeted advertising ecosystem. The introduction of AudioID highlights the ongoing efforts within the adtech industry to adapt to changing privacy regulations and consumer preferences. As the use of tracking cookies continues to decline, advertisers and tech companies are seeking alternative methods to track and target audiences effectively. In conclusion, SiriusXM's new AudioID solution, powered by AdsWizz, aims to track and identify its listening audience across its suite of apps. By matching user information and creating unique but anonymized identifiers, SiriusXM can target users with relevant ads while prioritizing privacy. While it remains to be seen how consumers will respond to this opt-in solution, AudioID represents the adtech industry's response to evolving privacy regulations and the decline of traditional tracking methods.
