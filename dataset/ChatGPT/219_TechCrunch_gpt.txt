India Seizes $725 Million Assets from Xiaomi Unit Over Illegal Remittances. In a major blow to Xiaomi India, the country's anti-money laundering agency, the Enforcement Directorate, has seized assets worth approximately $725 million from the Chinese smartphone company's India unit. The seizure comes as a result of Xiaomi violating India's foreign exchange laws. The Enforcement Directorate discovered that Xiaomi India had remitted the funds to three foreign-based entities, disguising them as royalty payments. It was revealed that these amounts were remitted on the instructions of Xiaomi's Chinese parent group entities and were intended to benefit the overall Xiaomi group. The investigation conducted by the directorate began in December and included scrutiny of Xiaomi and several other Chinese firms. The agency accuses Xiaomi of providing misleading information to banks during the remittance process, violating the country's foreign exchange regulations. Manu Jain, the former head of Xiaomi India, was previously summoned by the agency for questioning regarding tax-related compliances and company structure. The investigation has revealed serious allegations against Xiaomi, reflecting the agency's determination in cracking down on illegal activities, particularly those related to money laundering and foreign exchange violations. Xiaomi India has staunchly defended its royalty payments, claiming they were legitimate payments made for licensed technologies and intellectual property used in their Indian version products. The company holds a significant market share in India's highly competitive smartphone market. However, in recent years, it has faced challenges due to India's ban on Chinese apps citing national security concerns. This has adversely affected the popularity and market presence of several Chinese tech companies operating in India. The Enforcement Directorate's action against Xiaomi India sends a strong message to foreign companies operating in India, emphasizing the need to comply with the country's stringent financial regulations. The government's focus on combating money laundering and unauthorized remittances demonstrates its commitment to safeguarding national interests and maintaining financial integrity. It remains to be seen how Xiaomi India will navigate this setback and restore its reputation in the Indian market. Going forward, stricter regulatory scrutiny and compliance requirements are likely to shape the business landscape for foreign companies in India.
