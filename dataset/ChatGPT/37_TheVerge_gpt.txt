Last week, General Motors (GM) announced that it will be restricting access to Apple CarPlay and Android Auto in its future lineup of electric vehicles (EVs), citing the desire to offer customers a more integrated experience with native apps running on the car's infotainment display. However, other major automakers have responded by saying they will continue to offer CarPlay and Android Auto because their customers love the easy access and control of their smartphone apps. CarPlay and Android Auto have become wildly popular, with independent surveys suggesting that a large percentage of customers demand the feature. This move by GM has therefore surprised some, with many questioning its decision. Two pure EV automakers, Rivian and Tesla, do not offer access to CarPlay and Android Auto, despite loud protests from customers, yet they still manage to sell cars. This suggests that CarPlay and Android Auto might not be a deal-breaker for everyone. GM's CarPlay-and-Android-Auto-less future begins in 2024 with the Chevy Blazer EV. However, other major automakers, such as Ford, Hyundai, and Kia, have said that they will continue to offer CarPlay and Android Auto, as it has become a must-have feature for many drivers. The Chevy Blazer EV will instead offer a more integrated experience with its native apps, but it remains to be seen if this approach will resonate with customers. Some experts believe that customers are used to having access to their favorite apps and might not take kindly to this change. On the other hand, some are applauding GM's decision, saying that it will allow for a more seamless driving experience. Rather than having to rely on their smartphone, drivers will be able to control everything from the car's infotainment system. Regardless of the opinions, the upcoming decision will have a significant impact on the electric vehicle market. Customers will need to decide if they value integration over easy access to their favorite apps. The move by GM is also likely to shift the focus onto third-party developers who might need to work with car manufacturers to develop native apps for their infotainment systems. For customers who might be concerned about missing out on CarPlay and Android Auto, Chevrolet's parent company, GM, has stated that they will still be offering other features such as Alexa voice controls and wireless charging. Meanwhile, other automakers who are continuing to offer CarPlay and Android Auto might look to take advantage of this decision by promoting the feature in their marketing campaigns. A recent study conducted by JD Power showed that smartphone integration systems such as CarPlay and Android Auto have become one of the most important features for new-car buyers. The study showed that 70% of new-car buyers consider smartphone integration as important. The rise of smartphone integration in cars has largely been driven by the increased reliance on smartphones and the need for easy and safe access to important features such as calls, texts, and navigation. While GM's decision might have been seen as a surprise, CarPlay and Android Auto have become essential to many drivers, and it remains to be seen if GM's decision to restrict access will be seen as a mistake or a step forward in the evolution of electric cars. Despite this, other automakers are likely to continue offering CarPlay and Android Auto for the immediate future, as it has become a must-have feature for many drivers. As the electric vehicle market continues to grow, it will be interesting to see if more automakers decide to follow GM's lead and offer a more integrated experience or if they will stick with the current approach.
