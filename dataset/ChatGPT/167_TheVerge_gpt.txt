ZTE, the Chinese telecom company, is set to end its probation period in the United States after a judge's ruling on Tuesday. The probation began in 2017 after ZTE pleaded guilty to illegally selling American-made equipment in Iran and North Korea. The company faced a hefty fine of $1.2 billion for violating US sanctions against both countries. The US District Judge Ed Kinkeade chose not to punish ZTE for alleged visa fraud, which is a separate case currently ongoing in Georgia. It involves a ZTE researcher and a professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology accused of abusing the visa system to bring Chinese nationals to work for ZTE. While this ruling may benefit ZTE, it doesn't alter the fact that US government officials are still prohibited from using ZTE and Huawei products due to concerns over national security. This restriction also prevents telecom providers from utilizing government subsidies to purchase equipment from these companies. In response to the potential threat posed by ZTE and Huawei, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has decided to embark on a major operation to remove and replace their telecommunications equipment. This endeavor is estimated to cost a staggering $5.6 billion, underlining the seriousness of the concerns surrounding these Chinese companies. Despite the end of probation, ZTE will still face significant obstacles in regaining trust and expanding its presence in the US market. The ban on government officials using their products, along with the FCC's plans for equipment removal, demonstrate the extent of the skepticism surrounding the company's activities. ZTEâ€™s probation period coming to an end signifies a milestone in the company's journey after being embroiled in controversy. It remains to be seen how ZTE will navigate through the challenges ahead and whether it can overcome the perception of being a national security threat in the eyes of the US government and its citizens.
