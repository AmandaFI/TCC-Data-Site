Headline: US Exempts Internet Services from Russian Sanctions to Preserve Internet Access for Activists. Subheading: Nonprofit organizations advocate for internet access amidst ongoing sanctions against Russia. Date: [Insert Date]. The US Department of the Treasury has announced that telecommunications services are exempt from ongoing sanctions against Russia, in a move aimed at preventing a disruption of internet access for Russian activists. This decision comes after advocacy groups, including Access Now, urged the US government to ensure that internet access remains intact despite sanctions. The new order permits business transactions related to internet communication technologies, including messaging, domain registration, email, and sharing photos or videos. However, it does not authorize transactions involving Russian financial institutions or state-controlled entities. The Treasury Department's exemption acknowledges the importance of an open internet in enabling activism and access to information. Ukraine has been actively calling for the complete cutoff of the Russian internet, including requesting the revocation of Russia's access to the Domain Name System (DNS), which serves as a critical component of the global internet infrastructure. However, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) denied Ukraine's request, stating that such action could have devastating effects on the global system's trust and utility. Meanwhile, the Russian government has already blocked major global services and enacted its own restrictions on freedom of speech as a response to criticism surrounding its invasion of Ukraine. This move has further heightened concerns about the free flow of information and the stifling of dissent within the country. The exemption of internet services from sanctions aims to support Russian activists who rely on online platforms to voice their opinions and organize protests. By allowing the continuation of internet communication technologies, the US government seeks to maintain access to information and exchange of ideas for those within Russia. Several telecommunications companies have already made the decision to withdraw voluntarily from Russia, while others have suspended user accounts as a show of support for Ukraine. The Treasury Department's exemption provides reassurance to these companies that they can proceed with transactions related to internet services without violating sanctions. While this exemption is targeted towards telecommunications services, it signals a broader recognition of the importance of preserving internet access as a fundamental right. With the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the US government aims to protect the flow of information and ensure that individuals can exercise their rights to free expression and peaceful assembly online.
