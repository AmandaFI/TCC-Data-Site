Facebook users in the United States may be eligible for a portion of a $725 million settlement reached in a class action lawsuit related to user privacy. Parent company Meta has agreed to pay the record sum to resolve accusations that Cambridge Analytica and other third parties gained access to private user data without adequate consent from users. Facebook allegedly did not properly inform users of this access. . The lawsuit will cover US Facebook users with active accounts between May 24th, 2007 and December 22nd, 2022. Users who qualify can make a claim online or by mail until August 25th, 2023. This is the largest settlement ever achieved in a US data privacy class action case. It is also the highest amount that Meta, Facebook's parent company, has ever had to pay to settle a class action lawsuit. . The settlement has been tentatively approved by a judge and will be subject to final approval. Eligible Facebook users can retrieve their portion of the settlement by filling out a claim form. Details of the form will be available on a website set up specifically for this purpose. . The lawsuit was initiated by users claiming that Facebook allowed third-party companies like Cambridge Analytica to access and exploit their personal data without obtaining sufficient consent from them. Facebook had allegedly failed to properly inform users of this practice, and the users' private data were used for targeted advertising and political manipulation. . The lawsuit is a reminder of the importance of user privacy protections in an era of widespread data-sharing and the monetization of personal data. The settlement serves to hold companies accountable for failing to protect usersâ€™ private information. It also underscores the importance of individuals' data privacy and their right to adequate information about how their data is being used. The settlement, while a large sum, pales in comparison to the profits that Facebook has made from user data exploitation. In 2021, Facebook's revenue was $85.9 billion, and the company's net worth is estimated at around $1 trillion. Nevertheless, the settlement sends a strong message that companies must be transparent and hold themselves accountable for protecting user privacy.
