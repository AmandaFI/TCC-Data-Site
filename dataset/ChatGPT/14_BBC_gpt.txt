After much anticipation, Google has launched its new AI chatbot, Bard. Unlike its predecessor Lamda, this new product is available to the public and users can interact with it through voice and text. Bard is capable of accessing real-time information from the internet and has a Google-it button to search for answers. However, Google has put age restrictions on Bard as it is only available to those over the age of 18. . Compared to OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Bard has a more cautious offering and Google is hoping to use the chatbot to unlock creativity for its users. The aim of this product is to help users with their writing and generate creative ideas. Bard is a descendant of the earlier language model Lamda and combines natural language processing with deep learning to understand queries. The language model can also generate its own writing prompts for users. . Google has raised concerns about the accuracy of its search results and potential biases of Bard. The company warned that misinformation could occur as the chatbot learns from the existing real world. Google says it will closely monitor Bard to prevent bias and maintain its own "AI principles.”. The development of Bard has taken years and Google says it has invested millions in the new product. The chatbot will use neural networks, machine learning, and natural language processing to generate responses to queries. However, Google admits that there are still many limitations to how Bard can function. Despite this, the company believes that Bard is an important step in the development of AI technology. Google’s rivals, OpenAI, have been successful with their AI ChatGPT model. The language model is capable of predicting the next word in a sentence and generating natural language text. OpenAI has been developing this language model for several years and sees it as an important tool for assisting with creative writing tasks. Google is hoping to tap into this market with Bard and provide users with an alternative. Experts in the field have praised Google’s cautious approach with Bard. Clare Englande, a professor of artificial intelligence at the University of Cambridge, says, “Google’s AI principles are certainly a step in the right direction. It’s important that language models like Bard are used responsibly and ethically. I’m excited to see what creative writing prompts Bard can generate.”. The launch of Bard comes at a time when AI technology is becoming more prevalent in our everyday lives. AI chatbots, like Bard and ChatGPT, are just the beginning of what could be achieved in the future. With more developments in AI technology, we could see chatbots becoming more lifelike and conversational. Google’s Bard could be a crucial step in this evolution. Despite the excitement around Bard’s launch, it is important to remember that there are still limitations to what AI chatbots can do. They are only as good as the data they are given and are limited by the natural language processing capabilities of the algorithms. There is still a long way to go before AI chatbots are as conversational as a human. For now, Bard is a great tool for generating writing prompts and providing information on a range of topics. . Google’s Bard is now available to users over the age of 18 and can be accessed through the company’s chatbot platform. The chatbot is a more cautious offering from Google and the company hopes to use the technology to unlock creativity for its users. Google says it will closely monitor Bard to prevent bias and maintain its own "AI principles". The launch of Bard comes at a time when AI technology is becoming more prevalent in our everyday lives, and experts believe this could be an exciting development for the creative writing industry.
