India's Commerce Minister, Piyush Goyal, has issued a stern warning to e-commerce giants, such as Amazon India and Flipkart, urging them to adopt an open network platform or risk being shut out of the initiative altogether. The move comes as part of the government's efforts to democratise the e-commerce landscape by providing a zero-commission platform for buyers and sellers under the Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC). Several players from the industry, including PhonePe and Paytm, have already joined the interoperable network, which allows buyers and sellers to do business regardless of the service they use. However, Goyal expressed his disappointment that some of the bigger players had not yet joined the initiative and urged them to use their marquee apps to do so instead of launching new offerings. Goyal warned that companies that fail to do so within the stipulated time frame risk having their offer to join the ONDC withdrawn. The minister emphasised the importance of greater discoverability and more options for consumers, citing the ONDC's ability to offer these benefits to the industry. The ONDC's aim to create an open, inclusive e-commerce ecosystem has been welcomed by many in the industry. However, some have expressed concern that the initiative could lead to a concentration of power in the hands of a few large players, especially if the ONDC becomes the dominant platform in the market. Despite these concerns, Goyal remains optimistic that the ONDC will benefit the entire industry, including small and medium-sized enterprises. The initiative is part of the government's larger push towards self-reliance and has the potential to strengthen India's digital infrastructure and increase its digital capabilities. The government's efforts to promote an open, inclusive e-commerce landscape come at a time when India's e-commerce market is seeing significant growth. According to a report by Euromonitor International, India's e-commerce market is projected to reach $99 billion by 2025, growing at a compound annual growth rate of 22.4%. Overall, Goyal's warning to e-commerce giants highlights the government's commitment to promoting a more open, inclusive digital ecosystem. While some industry players may be resistant to the move, the ONDC has the potential to create a more level playing field and spur innovation in the e-commerce market.
