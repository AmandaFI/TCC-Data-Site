In a major blow to Microsoft's reputation, the US government has announced that the tech giant violated US sanctions by selling software to sanctioned entities and individuals in Cuba, Iran, Syria, and Russia from 2012 to 2019. Microsoft has agreed to pay over $3 million in fines as part of a settlement with the US Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). The majority of the apparent violations involved blocked Russian entities or persons located in the Crimea region of Ukraine. Microsoft sold things to companies that it could legally deal with, but then those companies turned around and sold them to companies that shouldn't have been able to get a hold of Microsoft products. Microsoft, Microsoft Ireland, and Microsoft Russia failed to oversee who was buying the company's software and services through third-party partners. The US Treasury Department said that Microsoft demonstrated a reckless disregard for US sanctions by failing to take adequate steps to prevent its products from being sold to sanctioned entities. Despite this, the company is being given credit for discovering, investigating, and self-reporting the violations. "There were also gaps in Microsoft's compliance procedures, and it had information that should have alerted it to the fact that a sanctioned party was using its products but didn't catch it for a variety of reasons," the US Treasury said in a statement. In a blog post, Microsoft said that it had since improved its compliance procedures and taken steps to ensure that its products are not used by entities or individuals subject to US sanctions. "We fully accept responsibility for the mistakes we made and have taken a number of corrective actions to strengthen our compliance processes," said David Howard, Microsoft's chief compliance officer. Howard also said that Microsoft had cooperated fully with the US government during the investigation and had taken disciplinary action against employees who were responsible for the violations. "We are committed to ensuring that our products are not used to violate US sanctions and will continue to work with the US government to ensure our compliance procedures remain robust," he added. Microsoft's violations are the latest in a series of cases involving US companies that have been caught doing business with companies or individuals subject to US sanctions. Last year, ZTE, a Chinese telecoms company, was hit with a $1 billion fine after it was found to have violated US sanctions by selling products to Iran and North Korea. The US government has been increasingly cracking down on companies that violate US sanctions, particularly with regard to Russia. In 2018, the US Treasury imposed sanctions on several Russian individuals and entities for their alleged meddling in the 2016 US presidential election. At the time, Microsoft said that it had uncovered a new Russian hacking group that was attempting to interfere in the 2018 midterm elections. The company said that it had disrupted the group's operations by obtaining a court order to seize control of the group's internet domain names. The latest case involving Microsoft is likely to raise concerns among businesses about the risks of violating US sanctions. It also highlights the importance of ensuring that companies have robust compliance procedures in place to avoid running afoul of US laws and regulations. "Companies need to understand the risks associated with doing business in countries subject to US sanctions and take appropriate steps to ensure they are compliant with US law," said John Smith, a partner at law firm Morrison & Foerster and a former director at the OFAC. He added: "The Microsoft case shows that even the biggest and most sophisticated companies can't afford to take compliance lightly.".
