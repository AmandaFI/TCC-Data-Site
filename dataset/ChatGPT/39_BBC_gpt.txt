UN climate report: Scientists release 'survival guide' to avert climate disaster. In a blunt warning to world leaders, a newly-released report on climate change reveals that current plans to prevent global temperature rises exceeding 1.5C are likely to fail. The report sets out to summarise key findings from research on climate change released since 2018 and is described by UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres as a "survival guide for humanity.". The report highlights a number of stark and worrying statistics, including projections of rising sea levels, increasingly volatile weather patterns, and more frequent and severe natural disasters. It warns that the world must act immediately and decisively to avert the worst effects of climate change. The UK government has urged all countries to take the findings seriously and towards "far more ambitious climate commitments." The report is backed by the governments of all countries involved. Commenting on the report, Mr. Guterres said: "This report must sound a death knell for coal and fossil fuels, before they destroy our planet.". The report concludes that the world must halve its greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 to stay within the 1.5C limit, and reach "net-zero" emissions by 2050. Achieving this will require unprecedented levels of cooperation and effort from governments, businesses, and individuals, as well as rapid cuts to fossil fuel use. The report notes that while progress has been made in some areas, such as the growth of renewable energy, this is not enough to meet the scale of the challenge. The report's release comes just weeks before the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow, where world leaders will gather to discuss and agree on new steps to combat climate change. The report is expected to shape the discussions and negotiations at the summit. Many experts and campaigners have welcomed the report's clarity and urgency. Christina Figueres, the former head of the UN climate change convention, called it "a deafening wake-up call." Environmental activist Greta Thunberg said it was "yet another reminder that the world's leaders are still failing us.". The report's authors have emphasised that the situation is not hopeless, and that there is still time to take action to avert the worst effects of climate change. The report provides a roadmap for achieving this, through a combination of measures such as decarbonising energy and transport systems, reducing deforestation, and improving energy efficiency in buildings. Despite the challenges, the report stresses that action on climate change will also bring significant benefits, including increased economic growth, improved air quality, and better health outcomes. However, the report also warns that there are risks of not taking action, including potential mass migrations, social unrest, and geopolitical instability. The report's release has been met with a mixed response from leaders around the world. Some have welcomed the report and expressed their commitment to achieving net-zero emissions. Others have been more cautious, with some questioning the practicality and cost of the measures required. In the UK, the report has put pressure on the government to take action on climate change, with the opposition Labour party calling for a "green industrial revolution." The government has said it will release its own plan for achieving net-zero emissions ahead of the COP26 summit. In the US, the report has been seen as further evidence of the need for President Biden's proposed infrastructure package, which includes significant investments in clean energy and transportation. However, the package faces opposition from Republican lawmakers, who argue that it is too expensive and will harm the economy. In China, the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases, the report has highlighted the need for the government to increase its efforts to tackle climate change. While China has made some progress in reducing emissions, it is still heavily reliant on coal and other fossil fuels. The release of the report has prompted renewed calls for action on climate change from civil society groups and activists around the world. Protests and rallies are planned in the run-up to the COP26 summit, with campaigners urging world leaders to take decisive action to avert a climate disaster. In the face of such widespread global concern, it is clear that action on climate change is no longer a matter of choice, but one of urgent necessity. The world must act now to avert the worst effects of climate change and secure a sustainable future for generations to come.
