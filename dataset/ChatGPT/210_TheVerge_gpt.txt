Biden group launches TikTok account to boost the president's agenda. In an effort to engage young people and promote President Joe Biden's agenda, the nonprofit group Building Back Together has launched its own TikTok account. The group's TikTok account, @buildingbacktogether, will create content inspired by TikTok trends and features, such as the green screen function, to explain President Biden's agenda to the platform's predominantly younger user base. With the 2022 midterm elections looming, Building Back Together aims to ensure that young TikTok users are aware of the positive impacts of President Biden's agenda. The organization plans to reach this audience by producing original content tailored to the platform, featuring their staff, news clips, and audio featuring the president. The announcement of Building Back Together's TikTok account comes at a time when the fate of President Biden's initial Build Back Better proposal remains uncertain. Last year, the proposal stalled, leaving crucial climate and social safety net provisions in limbo. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has expressed his commitment to pushing for the economic agenda, but its passage largely depends on Democratic Senator Joe Manchin. Manchin has opposed significant elements of the package, creating obstacles for its progress. Despite concerns over TikTok's Chinese parent company, the Biden White House views the platform as an effective tool for outreach. Recently, the White House was reported to be briefing TikTok creators about the situation in Ukraine, indicating a willingness to engage with young audiences through the popular social media platform. Building Back Together is fully dedicated to advancing President Biden's legislative agenda. The group actively supports bills like the American Rescue Plan and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, as well as Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson's nomination to the Supreme Court. Previously, Building Back Together ran a $10 million television and digital ad campaign to rally support for the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. In addition to their presence on TikTok, Building Back Together has been actively engaging with audiences on Instagram. On the platform, the group frequently shares news clips and infographics that promote the goals of the Biden administration. Their spokesperson has stated that their TikTok videos will take advantage of unique features provided by the platform, such as trending sounds, dances, and the green screen feature, to create informative videos about different aspects of President Biden's agenda. By setting up a TikTok account, Building Back Together hopes to bridge the gap between young people and politics. With the upcoming midterm elections, engaging young voters has become even more vital, and the organization believes that TikTok is an effective platform to connect with this demographic. The launch of Building Back Together's TikTok account marks the growing recognition of social media platforms as influential tools for political communication. As young people continue to flock to these platforms, political groups like Building Back Together are realizing the importance of meeting them on their preferred platforms.
