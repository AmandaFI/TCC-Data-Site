The annual Electronic Entertainment Expo, or E3, has been officially cancelled for 2021. This cancellation comes as no surprise to many, as larger developers had already been distancing themselves from the event over the past few years. For one writer, however, the cancellation is particularly bittersweet. Though they had never been to E3 in person, it had long been a dream of theirs to cover the event. "When I was a kid, I was always fascinated by E3," says the writer. "I would spend hours watching livestreams and reading news reports about all the new games and consoles.". As the years went on and the writer entered the world of journalism, their fascination with E3 only grew. But despite their dreams of attending the event and covering it firsthand, it never quite came to fruition. Now, with E3 officially cancelled, the writer admits to feeling a great sense of loss. "I know that E3 wasn't perfect," says the writer. "It put a lot of burden on developers, and the whole idea of the event may be outdated in this day and age.". But for the writer, E3 was more than just a trade show. It was an opportunity to discover new and exciting games, and to connect with peers and industry professionals. "I always loved discovering little indie games that I may not have heard of otherwise," says the writer. "And some of my best memories of covering gaming events have been just chatting with other journalists and game developers, sharing our thoughts and opinions on the industry.". There is, of course, the possibility that E3 could be brought back in the future. But for now, the writer is left to mourn the loss of an event that held so much potential. "I never got to experience E3 firsthand, but I'll miss it all the same," says the writer. "It was a part of gaming history, and even though it's no longer around, I'll always remember the excitement and anticipation that came with it.". For now, the writer plans to continue covering the gaming industry from afar, keeping a close eye on upcoming events and new releases. And if E3 does eventually return, the writer is determined to be there, finally fulfilling a dream that has been years in the making. "I may never have gone to E3, but that doesn't mean it didn't have a profound impact on me as a gamer and a journalist," says the writer. "I'll always be grateful for the memories and experiences that E3 brought to the gaming world, and I hope to see it return one day soon.".
