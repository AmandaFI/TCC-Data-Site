US technology firm Seagate Technology has been hit with a $300m penalty for allegedly violating export regulations on hard disk drives to Chinese telecommunications firm Huawei. The Department of Commerce stated that Seagate shipped $1.1bn worth of the technology after controls were introduced last year, alleging that the equipment could have been used for military purposes. Two other hard drive suppliers to Huawei reportedly ceased exports to the company in line with the new rules. The instalments on the settlement will be paid every three months for the next five years. The US has sought to limit sales of advanced technology such as computer chips to China, with Huawei remaining a particular focus for authorities. Earlier this year, the US banned the use of Huawei tech in government agencies and disclosed steps that would hinder Huawei’s ability to trade with US companies. The US views Huawei as a threat to national security, as well as accusing it of theft of US technology and sanctions violations. The Chinese firm denies these allegations. One of Seagate’s main competitors, Western Digital, has been seen as having a better relationship with the Trump administration. Reportedly, Western Digital is under investigation for hard drive exports to Huawei earlier this year, but the company has not previously been fined or sanctioned by the US. Furthermore, Western Digital has been held up as a key example of a US company developing its operations within China, reportedly doing business with the Chinese government in the construction of the “digital Silk Road”. Nevertheless, Western Digital’s earnings have been negatively impacted by the US trade war. Earlier this year, Chinese State-run tabloid the Global Times called for Beijing to hit back against US restrictions on Huawei access, stating that the “clock is ticking” for any potential retaliation. China’s Ministry of Commerce has criticised the US over its obstruction of Chinese technology firms, stating that such action by the US violates the principles of fair competition. Huawei itself has faced sanctions by Australia, Japan, the UK and the US, with the latter warning countries that using Huawei gear could harm their future intelligence sharing agreements with the US. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo stated earlier this year that the US was “making sure that we protect… American national security interests”, going on to state that the US was “not just going to roll over and permit these countries and these entities to have this information”. Meanwhile Huawai Deputy Chairman Ken Hu has stated that US restrictions will have a severe impact on the company’s ability “to bring advanced technology to the world”. The $300m fine imposed on Seagate comes as tensions rise between the US and China, with increasing numbers of US corporations seeking ways to insulate themselves from any negative impact on their business in the region. Without a resolution to the trade war, many US corporations fear that their prospects in China may become increasingly bleak.
