Scrona AG, a Swiss startup that made headlines in 2015 with its Guinness World Record for the smallest inkjet-printed color image, is now setting its sights on mass manufacturing with its 3D printing technology. The company plans to scale its printing technology to bring additive manufacturing and 3D printing to the forefront of the manufacturing industry. Scrona is specifically targeting applications for electronics, such as displays, printed circuit boards (PCBs), and semiconductors. The company's technology, which is based on electrostatic ejection, offers up to 100 times the resolution of traditional 3D printing methods and allows for printing in a variety of materials. To support its ambitious plans, Scrona has secured $6.7 million in a Series A funding round led by AM Ventures, a leading investor in industrial 3D printing, and also received a $2.9 million grant from the Swiss Secretariat for Education, Research, and Innovation. These funds will be used to further develop and optimize Scrona's technology for mass production. The ultimate goal of Scrona is to revolutionize the manufacturing industry by reducing the number of manufacturing steps required, as well as lowering material, energy, and water usage. By incorporating 3D printing technology into mass manufacturing, Scrona believes it can streamline production processes and reduce waste, leading to a more sustainable and efficient future. The potential applications for Scrona's technology are vast. With its high-resolution printing capabilities, the company aims to produce intricate and detailed electronic components that were previously difficult or impossible to manufacture. This includes intricate circuit boards, microchips, and even flexible displays. By leveraging the advantages of 3D printing, Scrona intends to overcome the limitations of traditional manufacturing methods, such as the time-consuming and expensive process of creating molds and tooling. The ability to quickly prototype and produce customized components is a significant advantage of additive manufacturing, and Scrona aims to make this accessible and efficient for mass production. Scrona's announcement comes at a time when the demand for electronic components is skyrocketing, particularly in industries such as consumer electronics, automotive, and healthcare. With its cutting-edge technology, Scrona is poised to make a significant impact on the manufacturing industry and potentially disrupt conventional manufacturing processes. As Scrona moves forward with its scaling plans, industry experts will be closely watching the company's progress. If successful, Scrona could pave the way for a new era in manufacturing, where 3D printing becomes a mainstream production method, revolutionizing various industries and allowing for greater innovation and customization.
