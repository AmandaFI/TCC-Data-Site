A group of hackers claims to have accessed 10 terabytes of data from Western Digital, one of the largest data storage companies in the world. The hackers are demanding a hefty ransom in exchange for not publishing the information that includes customers' details. Western Digital, which had disclosed a network security incident in April, recently declined to comment on the latest hack. According to one of the hackers who contacted TechCrunch with the intent of verifying their claims, the group did not encrypt the company’s files using ransomware. Instead, they attempted to steal data from the company’s SAP Backoffice, a back-end interface. The hackers have demanded a “one-time payment” of a minimum of eight figures, with the threat of retaliatory action if their demands were not met. They claim to be able to impersonate the company and have shared phone numbers allegedly belonging to several Western Digital executives. TechCrunch called the numbers and received mostly automated voicemail messages after the calls rang. However, the hackers shared a file that was digitally signed with Western Digital’s code-signing certificate, indicating their ability to sign files as if the company did it. If their demands are not met, the hackers have indicated that the information they have stolen will be made public on the website of Alphv, a ransomware group with a reputation for leaking non-compliant victims' data online. The Western Digital breach highlights the increased risk of cyber attacks against large companies that hold troves of sensitive data constituting valuable targets for cybercriminals seeking to extort money. The situation is further complicated by the rise in the number of people working remotely due to the Covid-19 pandemic, raising the risk of system vulnerability and breaches. As part of the security measures against ransomware attacks and to prevent data theft, companies must ensure that their networks are secure and that their employees are adequately trained to identify and neutralize attempted cyber breaches. They should also ensure regular audits of their systems to identify any vulnerabilities before hackers can these weaknesses. As the use of AI in cybersecurity has increased, there has also been a growing trend of cybercriminals using advanced technologies to their advantage. Therefore, establishing adequate cybersecurity measures and remaining vigilant against evolving threats must remain a top priority for all organizations. In conclusion, the Western Digital hack should serve as a reminder to all organizations that threats to their cybersecurity are significant and constantly evolving. They must remain vigilant and proactive in establishing robust security measures to avoid disruptions to their operations and loss of valuable data.
