Gogoro’s battery-swapping stations in Taiwan are now virtual power plants. Taiwanese battery swapping company, Gogoro, has partnered with Enel X, an energy services provider, to integrate 2,500 of its GoStations into Enel X’s Virtual Power Plant (VPP) to give energy back to Taiwan’s electrical grid. The VPP is a collection of small-scale energy resources that have been joined together and coordinated with grid operations in order to provide the grid with reliable and affordable sources of energy. Enel X is providing power back to Taiwan Power Company, Taiwan’s public electric utility. The pilot programme has shown that Gogoro's network can safely pause charging during a grid imbalance or provide energy back to the grid as required. The plan is to get to 2,500 GoStations across 1,000 locations by midyear. The integration of Gogoro’s GoStations into Enel X’s VPP helps ensure a more stable grid in Taiwan. It also provides Gogoro with a new revenue stream outside of mobility. Gogoro's battery-swapping system has gained popularity as a viable and sustainable alternative to traditional vehicle charging methods. Rather than plugging in and waiting for their vehicles to charge, Gogoro users can simply swap out their depleted batteries for fully charged ones at one of the company's GoStations throughout Taiwan. Now, Gogoro's GoStations are not only helping people move around, but they are also contributing to a more sustainable future by providing the electrical grid with reliable and affordable sources of energy. “We are scaling up to build a battery swapping network that doubles as a virtual power plant in Taiwan,” said Horace Luke, founder and CEO of Gogoro. “Our long-term vision is to reshape the way energy is distributed and consumed globally and we are starting by leading the transition into a sustainable future right here in Taiwan.”. Gogoro is also looking to expand its battery swapping network outside of Taiwan. The company recently announced plans to launch its service in Paris where 600 GoStations will be set up across the city. “Gogoro’s battery swapping technology is the backbone of a new energy paradigm that maximises the use of renewable energy while optimising power grids,” said Francesco Venturini, CEO of Enel X. “Our collaboration with Gogoro represents a remarkable opportunity to promote the uptake of electric mobility and further deploy VPPs, offering enormous potential benefits for the environment and society as a whole.”.
