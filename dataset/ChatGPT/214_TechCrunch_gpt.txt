Kenyan insurtech startup Lami Technologies is making waves in the insurance industry as it acquires Bluewave Insurance Agency, a fellow Kenyan startup. The move comes as part of Lami's mission to expand insurance coverage across Africa and democratize access to insurance. Bluewave Insurance, founded by Adelaide Odhiambo, has developed an innovative online platform that allows clients to access micro-insurance products through various channels such as USSD, SMS, WhatsApp chatbots, and web applications. This technology will be integrated into Lami's platform, enhancing its capabilities and providing a seamless experience for customers. The acquisition not only strengthens Lami's position in the Kenyan market but also opens doors for expansion into new territories. Bluewave Insurance already operates in Malawi and the Democratic Republic of Congo, giving Lami a foothold in these markets. Lami has expressed its intention to target additional markets, including Nigeria and North Africa, as it continues to grow. The timing of this acquisition is strategic, as Lami aims to address the low insurance penetration rates in Africa. Currently, insurance penetration on the continent is less than 3%, or 1.2% if South Africa is excluded. By offering affordable and accessible insurance products through its B2B2C approach, Lami hopes to drive insurance uptake and make it more accessible to individuals and businesses across Africa. Through its partnerships, Lami designs and distributes insurance products, reaching customers via a business-to-business-to-consumer model. Its innovative API allows entities like banks to offer digital insurance products to their customers. Lami has already established partnerships with companies such as Sendy and Kwara, further expanding its reach and impact. Lami is not content with merely offering traditional insurance products. The company expects the insurance sector to be disrupted through the use of technologies like data-driven pricing and artificial intelligence in claims processing and pricing. By embracing these innovations, Lami aims to revolutionize the insurance industry and provide customers with more accurate, personalized, and affordable coverage. The acquisition of Bluewave Insurance and the subsequent expansion into new markets mark significant milestones for Lami Technologies. The startup has quickly gained recognition as one of the leading insurtech companies in Kenya, and now it has its sights set on the rest of Africa. By leveraging technology and partnering with key players in the industry, Lami is well-positioned to make a significant impact and drive change in the insurance landscape. Adelaide Odhiambo, the founder of Bluewave Insurance, expressed her excitement about joining forces with Lami Technologies. She believes that the acquisition will enable them to reach a wider audience and deliver much-needed insurance coverage to individuals and businesses in Malawi and the Democratic Republic of Congo. The African insurance market is ripe for disruption, and Lami Technologies is at the forefront of this transformation. With its innovative platform and ambitious expansion plans, Lami is poised to bring insurance to the masses and reshape the industry. As the company sets its sights on new markets and continues to innovate, it is clear that Lami is committed to making insurance more accessible, affordable, and convenient for all Africans.
