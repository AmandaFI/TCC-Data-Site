Uber has sold its $400m stake in the Careem super app business, soon after the Middle Eastern ride-hailing firm divided its business into two separate entities: Careem Rides, which focuses solely on ride-hailing and is wholly owned by Uber, and Careem Technologies, which will operate the "Super App" along with all other related services. The latter will be owned jointly by Careem's co-founders, Uber, and Emirates Telecommunications. The latest funding from Emirates Telecommunications will allow Careem to "scale the Super App and build category-leading verticals in all our key markets.". Having sold its stake in Careem Technologies, Uber has demonstrated its willingness to play a more focused role in the ride-hailing market and further their collaboration with Emirates Telecommunications. The reshuffling of Careem's business model, which aims to make the Super App the more dominant of the two entities, is expected to further increase the ride-hailing firm's market share. Recently, Careem's CEO, Mudassir Sheikha, confirmed that the company, in addition to the new funding from Emirates Telecommunications, had also secured additional funding from existing investors, which included Saudi Arabian investment firm, Kingdom Holding. This move by Careem highlights the company's intention to expand its services beyond ride-hailing and capitalize on the growing demand for digital services such as food and package delivery, credit transfers, and bus services. The Super App aims to bring all of these services under one platform, making it the go-to destination for customers in the Middle East, and North Africa region. Careem intends to focus on expanding its verticals in the region and tapping into new markets to increase the Super App's user base. As part of the deal, Careem Rides will now be wholly owned by Uber, giving the ride-hailing giant a more substantial market share in the Middle East region and further strengthening its position in the global ride-hailing market. Commenting on the deal, Sheikha thanked Uber for its continued support and expressed his excitement for the future of the company. The sale of its stake in Careem Technologies comes as Uber ramps up its focus on new ventures, such as delivery services, freight, and electric bikes. The company has also been exploring new technologies, such as autonomous vehicles, to improve its services and increase its market share. With the success of the Super App, Careem hopes to leverage its user base and increase its partnership with Emirates Telecommunications, leading to further investment and expansion opportunities in the future.
