Disco, formerly known as Co-op Commerce, is a company dedicated to helping independent brands thrive in the competitive e-commerce space. By facilitating partnerships, data sharing, and merchandising collaborations, Disco aims to empower brands with the collective buying power needed to acquire new customers and drive results. The decision to rebrand as Disco was made to better reflect the company's commitment to "discovery" and assisting consumers in finding new products within its network. Through streamlined collaboration, tracking, and marketplace data analysis, Disco enables brands to make informed decisions regarding marketing and merchandising strategies. Since its inception, Disco has facilitated over $1 billion in transactions and attracted more than 40 million shoppers. Furthermore, brands utilizing Disco have reported cost reductions of 30% to 50% compared to major platforms like Facebook and Instagram. In its first year of operation in 2021, Disco experienced remarkable growth, with its revenue increasing tenfold. By lowering customer acquisition costs that often eat into brands' profits, Disco has emerged as a valuable partner for large direct-to-consumer brands such as The Honest Company, Parade, Lovevery, and Made In. Recognizing the company's potential, Disco recently secured $20 million in Series A funding led by Felicis Ventures, with participation from Shopify and other investors. These funds will be utilized to expand the team from 27 employees to 75 by the end of the year. Disco's primary objective is to help brands reduce customer acquisition costs and enhance customer targeting, particularly in the face of a future without cookies. With iOS 15 and other developments making marketing and advertising increasingly challenging, Disco sees this as a pivotal moment to expand its operations and attract more businesses. The company plans to concentrate on business-to-business marketing and establish its own marketing funnel to generate leads. Investors like Felicis Ventures were drawn to Disco due to its emphasis on addressing the escalating expenses associated with user acquisition. In recent years, securing new customers has become considerably more costly, leaving a void in the market that Disco aims to fill. While larger marketplaces like Shopify lack a strong focus on advertising space and customer acquisition, Disco aims to be the solution for direct-to-consumer brands in need of specialized support. Conner Sherline, the founder and CEO of Disco, expressed his excitement about the company's growth and the opportunities it presents for both brands and consumers. Sherline believes that when brands collaborate and leverage shared data and merchandising strategies, they can achieve significant results that benefit all parties involved. Disco's success thus far is a testament to the value it provides to brands seeking to expand their customer base and improve their marketing efforts. By offering a unique approach to brand partnerships and data-driven decision-making, Disco is reshaping the landscape of customer acquisition in the e-commerce industry. With its recent funding and plans for further growth, Disco is poised to become a leading player in assisting independent brands in navigating the challenges of the digital marketplace.
