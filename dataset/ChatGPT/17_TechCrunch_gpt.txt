500 Global, the US-based venture capital firm, is expanding its reach across the Caucasus and Eastern Europe, launching a start-up accelerator programme for companies in the region. The programme, hosted in Georgia, will speed up over 100 pre-seed to seed-stage companies with pre-seed investments starting at $100,000. The programme is part of 500 Global’s continued partnership with Georgia’s Innovation and Technology Agency and the Bank of Georgia. Since 2016, the trio has invested in three batches with a total of 43 start-ups out of the region. The start-up accelerator is designed to provide additional support to firms looking to launch their operations in the region and gain traction in an industry extremely competitive industry landscape. Entrepreneurs involved with the accelerator will work in a collaborative environment with like-minded individuals, gain access to industry experts, mentorship and resources, making them more visible in the start-up ecosystem. The launch of the start-up accelerator programme is an extension of 500 Global’s mission to foster entrepreneurship in the region and support companies to scale. While it was initially focused on aiding early-stage tech companies in Silicon Valley, geographically it has expanded its reach over the years and has invested in companies from all over the world. This move by 500 Global is set to bring a considerable amount of interest to the technology, innovation, and entrepreneurial ecosystems in the region. Entrepreneurs in the region will be on the lookout for new opportunities and more funding options available to them. Giga Jiqia, CEO of Georgia’s Innovation and Technology Agency stated that the Agency is proud to support the start-up community and provide support to entrepreneurs on their journey from idea to MVP and beyond. The partnership with 500 Global signals an expansion of this support beyond Georgia, enabling entrepreneurs in the entire region to benefit from our programmes. Start-ups from countries such as Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan can apply to participate in the accelerator's next round of funding. The programme is set to begin in September and applications will open in June. The cohort will consist of 15-20 companies. This move by 500 Global has excited the entrepreneurial ecosystem in the region, with stakeholders looking forward to more partnerships between the VC firm and local players. The launch of the programme is a significant step forward in fostering an innovative and entrepreneurial environment in the region. It is an indication of trust in the start-up ecosystem in the Caucasus and a sign that the region is where the world's leading investors and entrepreneurs should look. Georgia is strategic for 500 Global as it allows easy access to entrepreneurs across the region and provides an enabling environment. Georgia is a small country that has managed to punch above its weight in technology and innovation even with limited resources. Georgia has a strong IT sector and has made significant progress in developing its entrepreneurial ecosystem over the past decade. The country has been prioritising the development of talent in STEM fields by investing in education infrastructure and initiatives to encourage uptake of technology-related courses. According to the World Economic Forum, at least 6% of Georgia’s GDP comes from the technology and telecommunications sectors. The country's favourable tax policies and government support are also a significant draw for start-ups. The Georgian government has been supportive of its start-up community and has been rolling out initiatives to encourage growth and development in the sector. . Georgia's pro-business policies have seen it become an emerging regional hub for entrepreneurship, investment, and technological innovation. With the launch of this accelerator, Georgia will serve as a major gateway for 500 Global into the Eastern European, Caucasus, and Central Asian market.
