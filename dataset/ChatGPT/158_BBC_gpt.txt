Tanis: Fossil found of dinosaur killed in asteroid strike, scientists claim. In a groundbreaking discovery, scientists have unearthed a remarkably well-preserved dinosaur leg at the Tanis fossil site in North Dakota, shedding new light on the end of the reign of the dinosaurs. This leg, along with other fossils found at the site, is believed to have been killed and entombed on the same day a giant asteroid struck Earth, marking a catastrophic event that wiped out these ancient creatures. The Tanis dig has captured the attention of the scientific community and the public alike, with the BBC even filming at the site for a show narrated by the beloved Sir David Attenborough. This upcoming show will prominently feature the leg and other breathtaking discoveries made at Tanis. The impact site of the asteroid has been identified in the Gulf of Mexico, thousands of kilometers away from Tanis. However, the devastation caused by the impact was far-reaching, leading to the entombment of various creatures in different locations. The fossils found at Tanis present a unique assemblage, consisting of both aquatic and land-based animals. Interestingly, fish were discovered with small particles of molten rock from the impact in their gills. A chemical analysis of these particles has suggested that they originate from the asteroid itself, confirming a direct connection between the impact and the fossils found at Tanis. The fossilized leg found at Tanis is just one of the incredible discoveries made at the site. A fossil turtle impaled by a wooden stake, the remains of small mammals and their intricate burrows, as well as the preserved skin of a horned triceratops, have all been uncovered, providing a rare glimpse into life on Earth before the catastrophic event. The existence of Tanis and its claims came to light in the New Yorker magazine in 2019, raising eyebrows as scientific discoveries are typically presented in scholarly journals. However, in recent months, peer-reviewed papers have been published, lending credibility to the findings from Tanis. The team at Tanis vows to continue studying and describing the fossils, with more exciting discoveries anticipated in the future. The BBC show that has extensively covered the Tanis dig sought external expert opinions on the findings. One expert affirmed that the leg appears to be from an animal that perished instantaneously, further supporting the theory of a cataclysmic event. However, not all experts are readily convinced, with some desiring additional evidence before drawing definitive conclusions. Aside from the remarkable dinosaur leg, another significant finding at Tanis is the discovery of a pterosaur egg containing a preserved pterosaur baby. This find holds particular importance, as modern technology allows researchers to analyze the eggshell's properties and reconstruct the appearance of the baby pterosaur, providing unprecedented insight into these ancient creatures' early stages of life. The Tanis fossils and their implications for the understanding of the Earth's history will be presented at the European Geosciences Union General Assembly in May. In addition, the eagerly anticipated BBC show, featuring Tanis and its remarkable discoveries, is set to air on April 15th. The public can expect to be captivated by these ancient remnants, forever etched into the sands of Tanis, as they shed new light on the catastrophic demise of the dinosaurs.
