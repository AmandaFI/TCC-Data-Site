Leak: TikTok is launching generative AI avatars and hereâ€™s what they look like. TikTok, the massively popular social media app is now testing a new feature that utilizes generative AI technology to create profile pictures. The feature, which is currently being tested in select regions, enables users to generate AI-made headshots with just three to ten submitted photos and the selection of two to five desired styles. The AI-generated avatars have a similar appearance to the headshots created by Prisma Labs' Lensa app. According to reports, once the AI has generated the user's headshot, they can choose to save them, post them to their TikTok story, or set them as their avatar. Although many social media platforms offer the ability to customize profile pictures, TikTok's new feature stands out for its innovative use of AI technology to generate new headshots. Based on submitted pictures and user preferences, this new feature will automatically create unique and individualized headshots. TikTok has not given a precise date for the rollout of the feature, but sources predict that it will be released in the near future. The company has stated that the feature is still in its beta stage and is currently only available in select regions. The introduction of AI-generated avatars is significant as it provides a convenient and innovative new way for users to express themselves on the platform. Additionally, the feature can make profile pictures more accessible to users who do not have the time or expertise to create a custom avatar manually. In conclusion, TikTok's new AI-generated avatar feature represents a significant step forward in the field of social media profile customization. The feature provides an easy and intuitive way for users to create unique and personalized headshots, encouraging more users to engage with the TikTok platform and express themselves digitally.
