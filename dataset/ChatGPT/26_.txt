Farmers Warn Ukraine War Will Hit UK Food Prices. The National Farmers' Union (NFU) has issued a warning that the ongoing war in Ukraine will have a significant impact on food prices in the UK. According to the union, approximately 30% of the world's wheat comes from Ukraine and Russia, with exports being severely affected by the conflict. In addition, the rising cost of gas, used for heating greenhouses and producing fertilizer, has contributed to the increase in food prices. The NFU has called on the government to urgently support UK farmers in producing enough food to ensure supermarket shelves remain stocked and food remains affordable. In a letter to policymakers, the union highlighted the potential for years of disruption to food production, supply chains, and the availability and affordability of food in stores. The impact of the war on global food supply and costs was also echoed by the CEO of Yara International, one of the world's largest fertilizer companies. The Federation of Wholesale Distributors further added that higher fuel prices would result in increased food prices in shops and restaurants. NFU President Minette Batters expressed grave concerns about the rising cost of producing fruits, vegetables, and meat, warning that it could lead to a decrease in production at a time when the country needs more food. Batters emphasized the risk of farmers scaling back their operations due to the financial strain, which would result in reduced food production. The shortage of crops would also impact meat production as they are a vital source of animal feed. Although farmers have absorbed much of the costs themselves, the cost of producing chicken has already risen by 50% compared to the previous year. UK feed wheat prices have also seen a 39% increase since March 2021. According to the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), Russia and Ukraine are responsible for 80% of global sunflower oil exports and 20% of corn exports. The disruption in these supply chains will have a far-reaching effect on the availability and prices of these commodities worldwide. In addition to the disruption in supply chains, the shortage of Ukrainian workers due to the war is also taking a toll on food production in the UK. Ukrainian workers make up 60% of recruits under the UK's Seasonal Workers Scheme, carrying out crucial tasks such as planting, picking, packing, and grading fresh produce. The NFU has urged the government to address the labor shortage by issuing an additional 10,000 visas under the Seasonal Workers Scheme. Recognizing the severity of the situation, the UK's Environment Secretary, George Eustice, has implemented contingency plans for food security in the country. Eustice will also attend a special meeting of the G7 to discuss the issue further and seek collaborative solutions to mitigate the impact on global food supplies. The warning from the NFU serves as a stark reminder of the interconnectedness of the global food system and the vulnerability of supply chains during times of conflict. As tensions in Ukraine persist, the UK will likely experience the repercussions through increased food prices and potential shortages. The government's response and collaborative efforts with international partners will be crucial in ensuring the stability and affordability of food for consumers in the coming months and years.
