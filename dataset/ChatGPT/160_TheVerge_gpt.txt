Uber Will Feature NYC Taxi Cabs in Its App under Groundbreaking New Deal. Uber has announced a groundbreaking deal that will integrate New York City's iconic yellow cabs into its app. This agreement will allow approximately 14,000 taxis to receive trip requests from Uber customers, marking a significant shift in the relationship between Uber and the taxi industry. The deal involves licensed technology providers Curb Mobility and Creative Mobile Technologies (CMT) integrating their software with Uber. This integration will give yellow cabs access to Uber's larger customer base, potentially increasing trip volumes and income for cab drivers. It could also ease tensions between Uber and the taxi industry, which has struggled to replicate Uber's success with various smartphone apps. Riders will now be able to book trips through the apps owned by Curb Mobility and CMT, which operate in all of New York City's yellow and green taxis. They will pay the same fare for taxi rides as they would for an Uber X trip. Uber drivers in New York City are paid based on a utilization rate, and taxi drivers accepting Uber customers will be paid under the same rate. However, the yellow cab metered fare is calculated differently, so earnings may vary depending on the trip. One key difference between Uber drivers and taxi drivers is that taxi drivers will now see their expected earnings before accepting a trip. This feature allows them to make an informed decision and decline rides if they deem them not worth it. Uber will receive a cut of the fares earned by taxi drivers through its platform. It's important to note that taxi drivers will not be eligible for the recently announced fuel surcharge, as the minimum for-hire vehicle cost reflects a 5.3% cost of living increase. However, this integration is being portrayed as a way to rejuvenate the city's economy after the pandemic, as it provides a new source of income for taxi drivers and expands Uber's services. This groundbreaking deal is seen by Uber as a natural step forward, and the company hopes to eventually include every taxi in the world on its app. Uber has already formed partnerships with taxi industries in various countries, including Spain, Colombia, Turkey, Germany, Austria, South Korea, and Hong Kong. The integration of New York City's yellow cabs into the Uber app is particularly significant due to the history between Uber and the taxi industry. Uber's arrival in New York City a decade ago triggered a decline in the yellow cab business, with taxi owners arguing that Uber flouted regulations. Since then, the industry has been trying to adapt and compete with Uber's technological advancements. By integrating yellow cabs into its app, Uber is acknowledging the value and importance of the existing taxi infrastructure. This move has the potential to bring back customers who may have migrated to other ride-hailing platforms and could create greater stability and cooperation between Uber and the traditional taxi industry. The partnership between Uber and yellow cabs is not only a win for both parties involved but also for riders who can now benefit from the convenience and reliability of hailing a yellow cab through the familiar Uber app. Riders will now have more options and seamless access to different types of transportation within a single app, simplifying their travel experiences. As the city continues to recover from the impact of the pandemic, this deal has the potential to inject new life into the taxi industry and support the broader economy. With this integration, New York City is leading the way in reimagining the relationship between ride-hailing giants and traditional taxi services, setting a precedent that could be emulated in cities around the world.
