Zoom, the California-based video conferencing giant, has announced its acquisition of Irish startup Workvivo in a deal expected to be completed by the end of June. The move comes as part of Zoom's ongoing push to improve its enterprise communication tools, with Workvivo's technology focused on asynchronous communication and fostering employee engagement on a broad level. Workvivo's platform is essentially a modern intranet, featuring an activity feed, a people directory, surveys, and a conduit for critical company communications. Since its inception, the Dublin-based company has raised nearly $40m in funding and counts Amazon, RyanAir, and Bupa among its many high-profile clients. In 2020, Workvivo's growth skyrocketed by 200% in annual recurring revenue (ARR). The acquisition is expected to bring significant synergies, with Workvivo's technology complementing Zoom's existing product offerings. According to Zoom CEO Eric Yuan, the deal will provide "a powerful way to integrate employee engagement with the power and simplicity of Zoom". This integration is likely to help Zoom continue to grow its enterprise user base and cement its position as the leading provider of video conferencing technology. What sets Workvivo apart from other intranet and employee communications platforms is its focus on employee engagement. Rather than simply providing a static directory and communication portal, Workvivo enables companies to create a sense of community and foster collaboration among employees, regardless of their location or time zone. This is particularly important in the current environment, where remote work has become increasingly prevalent and employers are looking for new ways to keep their teams connected and motivated. Workvivo's technology provides several features for fostering employee engagement. For example, it enables companies to create and share internal social posts and recognize team members' achievements in real-time. Additionally, the platform allows employees to give feedback and participate in surveys, helping companies to make more data-driven decisions and better understand their workforce's needs. By leveraging these features, companies can build a more engaged and motivated workforce, leading to improved productivity and better business outcomes. Zoom's acquisition of Workvivo is expected to bring benefits to both companies. For Zoom, the deal provides an opportunity to expand its product portfolio and add new features that will resonate with enterprise customers. For Workvivo, the acquisition brings access to Zoom's extensive customer network and resources, allowing the company to scale its technology more quickly and reach new markets. Commenting on the acquisition, Workvivo CEO John Goulding said, "From the very first conversations with Zoom, we realized that we shared a common vision for the future of work, centered around empowering employees and enhancing their productivity. We're excited to join forces with Zoom and help shape the future of work together.". The acquisition of Workvivo is the latest in a string of deals made by Zoom in recent months as it seeks to expand its product offerings. Earlier this year, the company purchased Keybase, a secure messaging and file-sharing platform, and Five9, a cloud-based call center solution provider. These acquisitions are part of Zoom's broader strategy to become a one-stop-shop for enterprise communication needs, providing customers with a wide range of tools to help them collaborate and communicate more effectively. As the world's leading provider of video conferencing technology, Zoom has experienced explosive growth in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. As remote work becomes more prevalent, the company is well-positioned to continue to grow and expand its product offerings, with Workvivo's technology providing an exciting new avenue for growth. In conclusion, the acquisition of Workvivo by Zoom is expected to be a game-changer for both companies, bringing together cutting-edge communication and collaboration tools to enhance the future of work. With Workvivo's focus on employee engagement and Zoom's market-leading video conferencing technology, the acquisition is likely to have far-reaching implications for the future of enterprise communication.
