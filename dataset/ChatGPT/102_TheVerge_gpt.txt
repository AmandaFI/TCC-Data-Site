Internet giant Google is feeling the heat as its search business has seen slow revenue growth in Q1 2023. In comparison to the previous year, search revenues have only increased by 1.87%, indicating the growing competition from other AI-powered chatbot applications, such as Bing and the new kid on the block, ChatGPT. To combat the competition, Google has launched its own chatbot, Bard; however, Google employees have reportedly criticized the technology, deeming it "worse than useless." Despite the slow growth, Google's executives are optimistic about the ongoing performance of the search business, with CEO Sundar Pichai stating it is "performing well," and CFO Ruth Porat praising the business's "resilience.". The company is now focusing on building its artificial intelligence capabilities, with generative AI features planned for Workspace products such as Gmail and Docs. Furthermore, Google is planning to consolidate its Brain and DeepMind groups into one organization to ensure a more robust AI infrastructure. In other news, Google's cloud business has achieved profitability for the first time, expanding the company's revenue streams beyond just advertising, which is a significant milestone for the tech giant. Expanding beyond advertising has been a significant goal for Google in recent years, and the success of the cloud business is a promising development that aligns with the company's future ambitions. Despite the underwhelming search growth, rumors suggest that Google may have a few surprises in store for its upcoming Google I/O conference, which is set to take place in the coming weeks. One of the expected announcements is the upcoming release of new Pixel devices, which will build on the success of previous models. Google's competitors are continuing to increase their AI capabilities, and the market for AI chatbots is only set to grow, with experts predicting that chatbots will account for more than 80% of customer interactions by 2025. The lackluster performance of Bard, Google's own chatbot, is an opportunity for competitors, who will continue to innovate and improve their products. The ongoing competition and the evolving market have prompted Google executives to remain vigilant and attentive to the changing landscape of technology. They have made it clear that building out AI and cloud capabilities is a top priority for the company, and investments in these areas will be crucial for long-term growth. Despite the slow pace of growth in the search business, the success of Google's cloud business and the expected launch of new Pixel devices will provide a much-needed boost to the tech giant. As the market continues to evolve and competitors grow, Google is poised to innovate and stay ahead of the curve, maintaining its position as a dominant force in the tech industry.
