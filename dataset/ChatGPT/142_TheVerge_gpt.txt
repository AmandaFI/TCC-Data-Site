In a move that may signal a change in strategy, Gimlet, the podcast company owned by Spotify, has announced that it will be expanding distribution of some of its shows, starting with Science Vs, beyond its exclusive platform. The move hints at Spotify's recent acknowledgment of the limitations of exclusivity, and its failure to create new hit shows since its acquisition by Spotify over two years ago for over $190m. As part of the expansion, Gimlet will make Science Vs, a series that explores the scientific facts behind contentious issues, available on platforms including Apple Podcasts and Google Podcasts. The series has already gained a significant following, winning the Best Science and Medicine Podcast at the 2020 Webby Awards, and this move will provide it with further exposure and potentially attract a wider range of advertisers. The decision to expand beyond the confines of exclusive distribution is a recognition of the need to reach a larger audience, particularly as Spotify has struggled to create new hit shows since its acquisition of Gimlet. Established programmes like The Joe Rogan Experience and Call Her Daddy have been successful, but there has been a dearth of new content, with some shows being cancelled before they could even take off. Spotify's acquisition of Gimlet was supposed to be the start of the company's push into the podcast space and a way to compete with the likes of Apple, which has long dominated the market. While exclusivity was initially viewed as a way to attract new listeners and advertisers, it appears that the model has its limitations and can stifle creativity and growth. The move comes at a time when there is a growing trend of podcast companies moving beyond exclusive platforms to reach a wider audience. This includes companies like Wondery, which produces hit shows like Dirty John and Dr. Death, and has recently been acquired by Amazon to expand its podcast offerings. Additionally, the popular true-crime podcast Serial has moved beyond its exclusive platform of Apple Podcasts and released episodes on other platforms like Pandora. The shift in direction may also be a result of the pandemic, which has disrupted podcast listening habits and changed the advertising landscape. With more people working from home, there has been a decline in podcast listening during commutes, while advertisers have been rethinking their marketing strategies in the face of economic uncertainty. The move to expand distribution beyond Spotify is not entirely surprising, as Gimlet has previously made some of its shows available on other platforms after a period of exclusivity. However, this is the first time that a show will be made available on multiple platforms from the outset, indicating that this may be the start of a larger shift in strategy. The decision may also be a strategic move by Spotify, as the company faces growing competition in the podcast space. Apple has long dominated the market, but other players like Amazon, Google, and even Facebook are starting to make inroads. Additionally, there has been speculation that Netflix may enter the podcast market, following its recent acquisition of a production studio and the addition of an audio-only mode to its app. For Gimlet, the move may be an opportunity to get back on track after a period of cancellations and a lack of hit shows. While the company has continued to produce quality content, it has struggled to replicate the success of early shows like Reply All and Homecoming. By expanding distribution, Gimlet may be able to reach a larger audience and attract more advertisers, providing a much-needed boost to its bottom line. Overall, the move by Gimlet to expand distribution beyond its exclusive platform is a significant development in the podcast space. It signals a shift away from exclusivity as the sole driver of growth and hints at a more collaborative approach to producing and distributing content. As the podcast industry continues to evolve, it will be interesting to see how other players respond and whether this marks the beginning of a new era for podcasting.
