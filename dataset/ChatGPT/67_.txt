Voi, the shared micromobility company, has teamed up with Drover AI to deploy e-scooters in Oslo, Norway, in a bid to prevent sidewalk riding and improve safety for pedestrians. Drover's computer vision technology is able to identify whether a scooter is on the pavement, road, or cycle lane, thus helping to curb sidewalk riding. The use of advanced rider assistance systems has become increasingly important for micromobility companies as they strive to improve their reputation and comply with regulations set by cities. By implementing Drover's technology, Voi hopes to make a significant impact on scooter riders' behavior and improve its standing in the eyes of Oslo City Council. Voi recently had its tender extended in Oslo, and one of the factors contributing to its success was the high safety and parking score achieved through the use of Drover's PathPilot AI technology. As part of this partnership, hundreds of Voi's scooters in Oslo will be equipped with Drover's technology over the next few months. This will allow for the detection of sidewalk riding and inappropriate parking, with the ability to alert riders and bring them to a stop. Although Voi has not yet clarified how it will intervene if a rider misbehaves, it is expected that the company will take appropriate action to ensure adherence to regulations and maintain safety on the streets. This collaboration with Drover is similar to Voi's previous partnership with Luna in the UK, where smart AI cameras were used to improve scooter parking and prevent sidewalk riding. The successful implementation of such technology has proven beneficial in increasing compliance and reducing potential hazards caused by errant scooter riders. In addition to addressing the issue of sidewalk riding, the collaboration with Drover will also enhance geofencing capabilities and provide valuable insights on fleet usage and rider behavior. These insights can then be shared with Oslo City Council to optimize the e-scooter service and make informed decisions on future regulations. By understanding how the scooters are being used and how riders behave, Voi and the city council can work together to ensure the service is efficient, safe, and beneficial for all residents. This partnership between Voi and Drover comes at a crucial time when micromobility companies are under pressure to demonstrate their commitment to safety and adherence to regulations. As e-scooters continue to gain popularity around the world, it is crucial for companies like Voi to actively work towards improving rider behavior and addressing potential issues. By leveraging Drover's advanced technology, Voi aims to set a higher standard in micromobility and reshape the perception of e-scooters as a reliable and safe mode of transportation. Over the coming months, the deployment of Drover's PathPilot AI technology in Oslo will serve as a test case for Voi's commitment to safety and compliance. If successful, this collaboration could set a precedent for other cities looking to improve the regulation and management of shared micromobility services.
