LinkedIn has unveiled new ways for users to verify their identity and place of work, without the need for paid subscriptions or blue checkmarks. The professional social media network has partnered with CLEAR, a secure identity platform, to provide identity verification to US-based users. With this development, verified users will be able to display a new “Verifications” section on their profile, confirming that they have undergone the verification process with CLEAR. In order to qualify for a CLEAR verification, users will need to provide their government-issued ID and phone number. Further to this, users can also verify their place of employment by using their company email address. Working with over 4,000 companies on the platform, LinkedIn has made it easy for users to authenticate their current or past workplace. While previously this feature was only available to premium users, this update makes the feature free for all. Furthermore, LinkedIn has partnered with Microsoft to issue digital workplace IDs to eligible users for free. By providing digital workplace IDs, LinkedIn adds more layers of transparency and credibility to user profiles, making the platform more authentic and secure. According to LinkedIn, the platform believes that identity verification must be available to everyone for free. With its suite of verification tools now available, the company aims to make it easier for users to make genuine connections with others around the platform. This move by LinkedIn is a positive development in today’s digital world, where fake identities and fraudulent activity are a constant threat. By implementing these tools, LinkedIn can help its users to build trustworthy and authentic profiles, while also promoting a safer online environment. LinkedIn, which is owned by Microsoft, has over 740 million members worldwide, including over 260 million monthly active users. LinkedIn continues to expand its service offerings, with features such as LinkedIn Learning, job boards, and networking tools to help professionals connect with each other. The update comes at a time when many leading technology companies are doubling down on strong user identity and verification, to counteract the rising tide of online fraud and fake identities. Today, a verified identity is becoming imperative in the digital world, where privacy and security concerns are at an all-time high. The implications of LinkedIn’s recent changes could be far-reaching, not just for online professionals and job seekers but for recruiters and businesses looking to vet potential new hires. By making its protocol more transparent and authentic, LinkedIn is helping recruiters and hiring managers make more informed decisions and avoid hiring candidates with false or inaccurate identities. For businesses that are increasingly concerned about the security and legitimacy of their data, the implementation of these tools is likely welcome news. It not only provides an additional layer of verification for their employees but also helps businesses ensure that they are working with genuine suppliers, vendors, and contractors. In conclusion, the latest LinkedIn update is a much-needed step forward in offering users greater transparency and security, without the need for an added cost. With the partnership with CLEAR and Microsoft, LinkedIn is making it easier for users to verify who they are and where they work, helping to build a more trustworthy and authentic professional network.
