Spotify is saying goodbye to Heardle, the music guessing game it acquired in July 2021. Similar to popular word game Wordle, Heardle allowed players six tries to guess a popular song by listening to its intro. Many die-hard Heardle fans are feeling disappointed by the news, as Spotify had initially announced that Heardle would remain free to play for all. The game's closure isn't coming out of nowhere. Spotify wants to devote more energy towards music discovery through its recent app changes rather than through Wordle-inspired gameplay off-platform. Spotify recently rolled out a redesign of its mobile app experience and introduced new TikTok-style discovery feeds for music and podcasts, along with other features like Smart Shuffle for playlist recommendations, and a new podcast autoplay option. Spotify's decision to shut down the game comes just under a year after its acquisition of Heardle, and it is set to sunset on May 5 as part of the company's focus on other music discovery objectives. In a blog post, Spotify said "We acquired Heardle in July 2021 to add some fun to people's lives and help them discover new music in an interactive way". However, the streaming service's decision to maximize its focus on reaching new users through the app may mean that interactive gaming isn't central to their strategy. . Spotify is not giving up on other interactive experiences, and it will continue to invest in other gaming projects, like its Spotify island on Roblox and its in-app Gaming hub along with other integrations with Xbox and PlayStation. In fact, the company is currently testing three new games to experiment with different ways people might find and stream music in the future. The music streaming company declined to comment on whether it would be replacing Heardle with another game or interactive music discovery feature. It's possible that Spotify could add another game or service in the future if it found one that better fits with its app's evolving strategy. Fans of Heardle expressed mixed feelings about Spotify's decision to sunset the game. Some are disappointed, while others agree that keeping interactive features in the app isn't the highest priority, given the recent updates to the platform. . While Heardle enthusiasts are sure to miss the game, it seems that Spotify is making a decisive move to eliminate the interactive guessing game to focus on other updates. Whether it will be successful in bringing in new listeners remains to be seen, but one thing is for sure: Spotify remains committed to shaping the future of music discovery, and they'll continue to experiment until they get it right.
