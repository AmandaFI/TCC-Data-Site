Tile, the location tracking technology company, has launched a new product that aims to help cat owners keep track of their feline friends. "Tile for Cats" is a modified version of the company's Tile Sticker which comes with a silicone attachment that can be affixed to a standard cat collar. The device has a battery life of up to three years and a range of 250 feet. The product can be easily connected to Android and iOS devices and is also compatible with voice assistants including Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant. It is water-resistant and available in black and white colors. Tile for Cats is an inexpensive option for cat owners who wish to have a way to track their cat's movements without having to spend a lot of money especially if their cat stays mostly indoors. According to Tile, they launched the product due to a rising number of requests from cat owners who want to keep an eye on their four-legged friends. In a statement, Tile CEO CJ Prober said, "According to data presented to us, cat owners are less likely to let their cats outdoor than their dog counterparts, and we analyzed a way to create a solution for the cat owners who want to keep track of their cats without spending a lot of money. Tile for Cats is that solution.". Tile's latest offering is expected to be a game-changer for cat owners, particularly considering the device's extensive battery life of up to three years. Currently priced at $25, Tile for Cats is available for purchase on the official Tile website. Whether your furry friend is indoors or outdoors, Tile for Cats provides peace of mind for cat owners, tracking the movements of their beloved pets easily and without breaking the bank.
