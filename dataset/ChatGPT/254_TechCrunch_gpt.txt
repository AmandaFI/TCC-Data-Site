How ‘Feature Bloat’ is Driving the Chip Shortage. In an era where technology seems to be advancing at the speed of light, it's no surprise that the automotive industry is also getting caught up in the tech frenzy. Consumers are demanding more and more advanced features in their cars, and automakers are racing to meet these expectations. However, this rush to add excessive amounts of technology, known as "feature bloat," is now contributing to the ongoing chip shortage crisis. At CES 2022, the world's largest consumer electronics show, the automotive industry showcased some of the most cutting-edge technology imaginable. Augmented reality head-up displays, audio systems with thousands of watts and speakers, and the ability to change the exterior color of cars were just a few of the mind-boggling features on display. While these advancements may seem impressive, there is a darker side to the story. Many of these high-tech features are still unreliable, resulting in higher prices and spotty availability for consumers. The excessive amount of software in cars is a major culprit behind this issue. Whereas cars from a decade ago had around 10 million lines of code, vehicles now have a staggering 100 million lines. This software bloat is a byproduct of the accelerated vehicle development cycle, as automakers try to keep up with the fast-paced world of consumer electronics. For automakers, the rise of electric vehicles (EVs) has only exacerbated the feature bloat problem. In an effort to justify the high cost of EVs and differentiate themselves from competitors, automakers have been packing these vehicles with as much technology as possible. However, this has resulted in EVs being among the least reliable vehicles on the market, plagued with buggy software and coding problems. The solution, according to experts, lies in taking a smarter approach. Automakers need to determine what features customers actually want and need, rather than trying to include every possible tech advancement. By focusing on the essentials and avoiding feature bloat, automakers can improve reliability, reduce costs, and better meet consumer expectations. Another issue mentioned in the article is the reliance on software contractors. Many automakers outsource their software work to suppliers, which can lead to integration and compatibility issues. The article suggests that by bringing software development and integration in-house, automakers can have better control over the overall experience for consumers. Consumer expectations also play a significant role in the feature bloat issue. Surveys have shown that a significant percentage of car owners, especially in the younger demographic, expect better feature functionality in their next vehicle. This demand for advanced tech features is unlikely to diminish, despite the challenges posed by the chip shortage. Automakers understand the importance of catering to consumer desires in order to maintain profits and market share. However, due to the chip shortage, these expectations are not likely to be met in the short term. The article warns of longer wait times, reduced features in new cars, and potentially higher prices as a result. The chip shortage, caused in part by increased demand for consumer electronics during the pandemic, has left the automotive industry scrambling for supply. In conclusion, the issue of "feature bloat" in the automotive industry is not only leading to unreliable technology and higher prices but is also exacerbating the chip shortage. The excessive amount of software in cars, driven by consumer demand and competition, is burdening vehicles with features that may not necessarily be wanted or needed. The rise of electric vehicles has further contributed to the problem, as automakers try to differentiate their EVs through advanced technology. However, by taking a smarter approach, focusing on essential features, and bringing software development in-house, automakers can combat feature bloat and improve reliability. Despite the challenges posed by the chip shortage, the demand for high-tech cars is unlikely to diminish, and automakers will continue to innovate to meet consumer expectations.
