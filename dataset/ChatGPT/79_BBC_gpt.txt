The Evil Dead: The horror shocker that set off a culture war. Forty years ago, on April 15, 1981, The Evil Dead made its debut on the big screen in the United Kingdom. Directed by Sam Raimi, this classic horror film was met with both critical acclaim and public outrage. At the forefront of the backlash against the film was campaigner Mary Whitehouse, who famously labelled it a "video nasty" and called for it to be banned. Her campaign laid the foundation for what would become a culture war over the regulation of violent and sexual content in films in the UK. The film follows a group of college students in a remote cabin in the woods who unwittingly unleash demonic forces that possess and kill them one by one. The film's combination of graphic violence and sexual content was seen as particularly shocking at the time. However, it was this very controversy that helped to propel the film to success, especially in the UK where it became one of the biggest-selling VHS releases of the 1980s. Despite the outcry, The Evil Dead continued to gain a cult following over the years. It spawned two sequels, Evil Dead II and Army of Darkness, both directed by Raimi and starring Bruce Campbell as the protagonist Ash. The franchise also inspired a 2013 reboot directed by Fede √Ålvarez and a TV series, Ash vs. Evil Dead, which ran for three seasons from 2015 to 2018. Now, on the 40th anniversary of the original film's release, fans are eagerly awaiting the release of Evil Dead Rise, the latest addition to the franchise. Directed by Lee Cronin, the film features a new cast and promises to take the series in a new direction. Despite the controversy that has surrounded The Evil Dead over the years, its influence on the horror genre cannot be denied. Its innovative camera work, use of practical effects, and depiction of demonic possession have inspired countless filmmakers, making it one of the most iconic horror films of all time.
