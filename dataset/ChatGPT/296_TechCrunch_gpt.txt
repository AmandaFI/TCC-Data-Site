Otta, a London-based job platform that takes a database approach to matching job seekers with tech companies, has raised $20 million in a Series A funding round led by Tiger Global Management. The platform aims to provide transparency and help candidates find meaningful work, especially as the "Great Resignation" during the pandemic has emphasized the importance of job satisfaction and remote work. Otta differentiates itself from other job platforms like LinkedIn by aggregating information about companies, including founder bios, employee reviews, salaries, and industry details. This helps job seekers determine if a company aligns with their values and ambitions before applying. With over 250,000 high-growth companies struggling to attract talent, Otta focuses on prioritizing candidates and offering a candidate-first job search experience. Since its launch in January 2020, Otta has experienced significant growth. The platform has seen applications increase from 1,000 per month to over 5,000 per day, indicating a strong demand for its services. With the new funding, Otta plans to expand its presence in the US market, tapping into the vast talent pool available there. Additionally, the company intends to double its product and engineering team in London to support its growth and further enhance its platform. The funding round led by Tiger Global Management is a testament to Otta's potential and the value it brings to the job market. Tiger Global Management is a leading global investment firm known for backing high-growth companies in technology, e-commerce, and other sectors. The firm's investment signals confidence in Otta's ability to disrupt the traditional job search process and provide a more efficient and meaningful experience for both job seekers and companies. Otta's CEO and co-founder, Sam Franklin, expressed excitement about the funding and the opportunities it presents. Franklin stated, "We're thrilled to be partnering with Tiger Global as we continue our mission to make job search better for everyone. With their support, we will be able to accelerate our growth and reach more job seekers and companies, helping them find the perfect match.". The COVID-19 pandemic has shifted the dynamics of the job market, with many professionals reassessing their career paths and priorities. The so-called "Great Resignation" has seen a surge in job switches and a greater focus on job satisfaction and work-life balance. Otta aims to capitalize on this trend by providing job seekers with relevant information and opportunities that meet their aspirations. Through its user-friendly platform, Otta empowers job seekers to make informed decisions about potential employers. By aggregating data, the platform enables candidates to compare companies and find the right fit based on their values, work culture, and growth opportunities. Otta's database approach sets it apart from other job platforms, giving it a unique selling point in an increasingly competitive market. As Otta expands its presence in the US and grows its team in London, job seekers worldwide can expect an improved job search experience. The platform's focus on transparency, candidate prioritization, and meaningful work aligns well with the changing expectations of today's job seekers. With the support of Tiger Global Management, Otta is well-positioned to revolutionize the job market and help individuals find their dream jobs with ease.
