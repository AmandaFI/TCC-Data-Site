Europe Names 19 Platforms That Must Report Algorithmic Risks under DSA. The European Union (EU) has announced the names of 19 online platforms that will be subjected to the strictest level of regulation under the Digital Services Act (DSA) rules. Of the 19, two platforms belong to Very Large Online Search Engines (VLOSEs), Google Search and Bing, while the rest are Very Large Online Platforms (VLOPs) that include 17 for-profit US companies and a couple of international players and Wikipedia. The new regulations are designed to increase algorithmic transparency and manage risks associated with online platforms, including misinformation and illegal content. Once ratified by the EU Parliament, the new measures will require VLOSEs and VLOPs to introduce artificial intelligence transparency requirements and mechanisms for users to report illegal content. The platforms must also provide detailed information on recommended content and give users the right to opt-out of personalised recommendations based on profiling. The EU has made algorithmic transparency a cornerstone of its digital policies, aiming to protect consumers from discriminatory practices, filter bubbles, and online radicalisation. Under the DSA, the EU has created three categories of digital service providers (DSPs), each with different responsibilities and obligations. The first category, which includes VLOSS, is made up of companies that provide online search engines and digital content aggregators that rely on a significant amount of user-generated content. The second category includes VLOPs, which are platforms that allow users to interact with each other, participate in social networking, or share content. These platforms, like Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube, often rely on algorithms to identify and recommend content to users. The third category of DSPs pertains to online marketplaces, i.e. platforms that facilitate the buying or selling of goods and services between merchants and consumers. The DSA holds VLOSEs and VLOPs to higher standards than online marketplaces since they pose greater risks in areas related to consumer safety, fundamental rights, and public interests. Once ratified, the DSA will require VLOSEs and VLOPs to establish risk management systems and provide annual transparency reports detailing how their algorithms are used to deliver content to users. The regulation may require companies to explain how they use user data, which data types they collect, and how they use data to make decisions. Furthermore, VLOSEs and VLOPs must offer users detailed explanations for why certain content is recommended to them. The platforms are also required to provide users with clear information on the factors that influenced the content and give users the right to opt-out of personalised recommendations based on profiling. The EU's efforts to regulate online platforms through the DSA come at a time when tech giants are facing increasing scrutiny from lawmakers across the globe. Social media companies have come under fire from politicians and regulators for their role in spreading misinformation during election cycles and hosting extremist content. The European Commission has welcomed the DSA's provisions for regulating online platforms, stating that it will establish a level playing field for all market players while ensuring consumer protection and transparency. While the EU has moved to regulate VLOSEs and VLOPs, however, some experts are concerned that the new regulations may actually be counterproductive. Critics of the DSA argue that the regulations could stifle innovation, increase costs for small and medium-sized platforms, and create barriers for emerging tech startups. Moreover, some observers worry that the DSA places too much responsibility on VLOSEs and VLOPs to monitor content without considering the broader societal and ideological factors that lead to online extremism and misinformation. Nevertheless, the EU has taken a strong stance in regulating online platforms and is committed to promoting algorithmic transparency and protecting consumers' rights. The introduction of the DSA marks a significant step towards achieving those goals.
