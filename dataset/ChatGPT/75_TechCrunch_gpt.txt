German enterprise software provider Parloa has raised €20m ($21.67m) in a series A funding round led by EQT Ventures to help companies automate their contact centres. The funding will be used for customer acquisition efforts, opening a US office and product R&D. Parloa, which was founded in 2017 by CEO Malte Kosub and Stephan Ostwald as part of Future of Voice, offers a range of apps and services that automate contact centre flows using low-code drag-and-drop dashboards. The combination of conversational AI tech and low-code tools allows customers to quickly create automated phone bots, translation tools or chat bots. The company has already worked with a number of big-name clients, including BMW, and it aims to serve as a technology partner for contact centre managers looking to automate their operations without having to invest a lot of time and money into software development. "With our conversational AI technology, we enable contact centers to automate customer service processes, making the experience more efficient, more engaging and far more satisfying for both customers and agents," said Kosub. The move towards automation in contact centres has been driven by a number of factors, including a rise in call volume and complexity, pressure to provide better customer service and a need to manage costs. Parloa's approach is designed to help companies address these challenges without having to hire more staff or invest in complex software platforms. "Our approach is to make it easy for companies to build and deploy conversational bots and other AI-powered solutions using a drag-and-drop interface and minimal coding," said Ostwald. "This saves time, reduces costs and delivers better results than traditional software development approaches.". The funding round was also backed by Coparion, High-Tech Gründerfonds, VITO Ventures and a number of angel investors. According to Parloa, the funds will be used to expand its sales and marketing efforts, open a US office and invest in R&D to improve its conversational AI technology. "We're very excited about the potential of Parloa's platform to help companies transform their customer service operations," said Lyle Fong, venture partner at EQT Ventures. "Their unique combination of conversational AI and low-code tools has the potential to disrupt the market and help businesses of all sizes improve their customer experiences.". Parloa's platform includes a range of tools and services that allow companies to automate their contact centre operations using a combination of conversational AI, low-code dashboards and drag-and-drop interfaces. The company's technology can be customized to meet the specific needs of each individual client, ensuring that their customer service processes are streamlined, efficient and effective. "We believe that there is a huge opportunity in the market for companies that can provide simple, effective solutions for automating contact centre operations," said Kosub. "With this new funding, we'll be able to expand our reach, develop new features and services and help even more companies automate their operations and improve their customer experiences.". While automation in contact centres is still a relatively new field, it is expected to grow rapidly in the coming years as more businesses look for ways to improve their customer service processes. Parloa's approach, which combines conversational AI and low-code tools, is seen as an innovative solution to this challenge, and the company is poised to play a leading role in the evolution of this industry.
