After losing sight of its initial pitch, Mojo Vision has undergone a major pivot and is now focused on commercialising the micro-LED display technology used in its smart contact lenses. The California-based company was initially developing a revolutionary device in the form of a contact lens that would enable users to access information with a simple blink. However, it soon became apparent that this concept was not feasible in the near term, prompting the company to shift its attention towards refining the micro-LED display technology within its lenses. Mojo Vision has just raised $22.4m in a new funding round, with contributors including existing backers NEA and Khosla Ventures, as well as new investors like Liberty Global Ventures, Dolby Family Ventures and Fusion Fund. The funds will be used to further develop the company's micro-LED technology and to bring it to market. The new CEO of Mojo Vision is Nikhil Balram, who was previously the company's Senior Vice President and GM of micro-LED. Balram joined Mojo in January 2020, bringing with him extensive experience in the display and semiconductors industry. He has been instrumental in driving the pivot towards micro-LED technology, and is now leading the commercialisation efforts. Micro-LED displays are significantly smaller and more efficient than traditional LED technology, and can be used in a wide range of applications, from wearables and automotive displays to augmented reality and virtual reality headsets. Mojo plans to target these markets, as well as medical devices and military applications, with its micro-LED technology. According to Balram, Mojo's micro-LED displays are "10 to 100 times more efficient than OLED displays", and can achieve "10,000 to 100,000 times higher brightness per unit area than any other display in the world". This technology could potentially enable new experiences in AR and VR, as well as new form factors for wearables and other devices. Mojo Vision has been developing its micro-LED technology for several years, and has already made significant progress in miniaturising the displays and making them more power-efficient. The company's current focus is on improving the resolution and transparency of the displays, as well as integrating them into wearable devices. The pivot towards micro-LED technology marks a significant shift for Mojo Vision, which had initially captured the attention of the tech industry with its ambitious smart contact lens concept. However, the company's leadership team soon realised that the technology required to make the concept a reality was still many years away from being commercially viable. By pivoting towards micro-LED displays, Mojo has positioned itself as a player in a rapidly growing market, with analysts projecting that the global micro-LED display market could be worth $20bn by 2025. The company faces strong competition from established players like Samsung and Apple, as well as other startups like Plessey and VueReal, but Balram is confident that Mojo's technology has several unique advantages. Mojo Vision's micro-LED displays are designed to be ultra-thin, flexible and transparent, making them ideal for use in wearables and other lightweight devices. The displays can also be customised to suit different applications and form factors, giving Mojo a wider range of potential customers. With its new funding round and experienced leadership team, Mojo Vision is well-positioned to make a splash in the micro-LED display market. While it may have lost sight of its initial pitch for a smart contact lens, the company's pivot towards micro-LED technology is a clear sign that it is still focused on delivering innovative solutions that can transform the way we interact with the world around us.
