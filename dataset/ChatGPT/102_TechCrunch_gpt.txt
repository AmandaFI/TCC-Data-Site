Snapchat's AR technology is branching out of the digital world and into the real world with the introduction of "AR Mirrors". The new feature allows businesses to enhance in-store experiences, with Nike and Men's Wearhouse among the first brands to test the technology. AR Mirrors are part of Snap's updated AR Enterprise Services platform, which now includes a Shopping Suite. The suite enables businesses to incorporate AR experiences into their apps and e-commerce sites, such as AR Try-On and 3D product viewing. Various retailers, including Princess Polly and Goodr, have already implemented the tools, reporting significant improvements in metrics. Snap has been investing heavily in AR, and its efforts have paid off. The company's AR lenses have been a hit, with more than 200 million Snapchatters using them each day. Now, Snap is expanding its AR capabilities to help businesses provide more engaging and personalized experiences for their customers. According to Snap, the updated AR Enterprise Services platform is designed to "make it easier and more cost-effective for businesses to create, manage, and distribute AR experiences at scale.". One of the features of the updated platform is the Shopping Suite, which includes AR Try-On and 3D product viewing. With AR Try-On, customers can see how clothes, makeup, and accessories look on them without having to try them on physically. This feature has been used by Princess Polly, an Australian fashion retailer, to increase engagement and conversion rates. The retailer saw a 44% increase in time spent in the AR Try-On feature, and a 30% increase in add-to-cart rates. The 3D product viewing feature allows customers to view products in a three-dimensional space, giving them a better idea of what the product actually looks like. Goodr, an eyewear company, used this feature to increase engagement and conversion rates. The company saw a 3.5x increase in time spent in the AR experience, and a 66% increase in add-to-cart rates. In addition to the Shopping Suite, Snap has introduced AR Mirrors, which allows businesses to enhance in-store experiences. Nike and Men's Wearhouse have already tested the technology, and the results have been positive. Nike used the AR Mirrors feature in its flagship store in New York City to create a personalized, interactive shopping experience. Customers can use the mirrors to see how different sneakers look on them, and can even change the color of the sneakers with a simple swipe. Men's Wearhouse used the AR Mirrors feature to create a virtual dressing room in its stores, allowing customers to see how different suits look on them without having to physically change clothes. Snap is also working on an AR-enabled vending machine with Coca-Cola. The vending machine will be equipped with cameras and sensors that will recognize hand gestures, allowing users to interact with the machine in a completely new way. For example, users could wave their hand to browse through different beverage options, and then make a selection by making a fist. The AR Mirrors feature and the Coca-Cola vending machine are just two examples of how AR technology is being used to create more engaging and personalized experiences for customers. As AR continues to evolve, it's likely that we'll see even more innovative applications of the technology in the near future. And with Snap's updated AR Enterprise Services platform, businesses of all sizes will have the tools they need to create and distribute AR experiences at scale.
