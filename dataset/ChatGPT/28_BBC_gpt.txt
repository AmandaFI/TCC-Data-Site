Commercial development of gene-edited food is now legal in England, following the relaxation of laws around the technology. The new legislation, known as the Precision Breeding Act, allows for genetic changes that could also have been produced through traditional breeding programmes or occurred naturally. The act outlaws the use of genetically modified (GM) crops, which involve introducing genes from other species. Supporters of gene-editing argue that the technology will help develop hardier crops that are better suited to surviving climate change. It could also make farm animals resistant to diseases, requiring fewer antibiotics and reducing the risk of antibiotic resistance. However, gene-editing remains controversial due to concerns over its potential impact on human health and the environment. Critics argue that there is still too little known about the effects of edited genes on ecosystems and that the technology could lead to unforeseen consequences. One contentious aspect of the new law is the lack of labelling requirements for gene-edited food. This has sparked concerns from consumer advocates who argue that people have a right to know what they are eating. However, proponents of gene-editing argue that there is no need for labelling as the edited products are identical to those produced through traditional breeding methods. The Welsh government has voiced opposition to the new law, arguing that it undermines the devolution settlement which gives Wales the power to regulate its own agricultural policies. Meanwhile, the Scottish government remains opposed to GM technology, despite support for gene-editing from the National Farmers’ Union (NFU) Scotland. The UK government argues that the new law will help the country to remain at the forefront of agricultural innovation and secure food supplies for future generations. Environment Secretary George Eustice said: “The UK is now a pioneer in this field, helping to shape the future of farming across the world.”. The decision to legalise commercial gene-editing follows a public consultation launched by the UK government in 2018. The consultation received over 11,000 responses, with the majority of respondents supporting a relaxation of laws around gene-editing. However, the legislation does not apply to Scotland or Wales, which have their own separate agricultural policies. Wales has already banned GM crops, while Scotland has implemented a policy of “GM-free” farming. It remains to be seen how these policies will interact with the UK government’s new legislation. In conclusion, the new law represents a significant shift in the UK’s approach to gene-editing and could have major implications for the country’s agricultural sector. The technology has the potential to revolutionise the way crops are grown and animals are raised, but also raises important questions about ethics, safety, and transparency. As the effects of the new law become clear, it will be important for regulators to monitor its impact closely and ensure that it does not lead to unintended consequences.
