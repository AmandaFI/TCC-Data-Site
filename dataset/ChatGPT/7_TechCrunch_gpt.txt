Betaworks, a New York-based startup studio and VC firm, is launching a new seed-stage AI program aimed at funding world-changing early-stage AI startups. The program, which is set to start from mid-June and run through until mid-September, will offer approximately ten companies a share of the $500,000 funding on offer as well as mentorship, events, business building and collaboration opportunities. Betaworks aims to support promising machine learning and AI projects that are designed to augment the way humans behave, create, play, work and think. CEO John Borthwick believes that the AI stack hasn't been fully defined yet, and he sees enormous potential for the companies involved in this cohort to help define it. The decision to launch the new seed-stage AI program comes as demand for AI companies is on the rise and investment in AI companies is becoming increasingly important for both the private and public sector. As companies in various industries begin to explore the potential of AI, the number of organizations looking to invest in early-stage AI startups is also starting to rise. In an effort to tap into this growing demand, Betaworks is offering a program that is specifically designed to help early-stage AI startups overcome the challenges of bringing their technology to market. Betaworks' new AI program has secured support from some notable investors, including Mozilla Ventures, Greycroft, and Differential Ventures, all of whom are keen to help the company identify and support the most promising AI startups. The program comes at a time when AI is becoming increasingly important for a wide range of applications, from healthcare to transportation to finance. Many investors and venture capitalist firms are seeing the potential for AI to transform these industries, and they are investing accordingly. Betaworks is looking to fund AI startups that can help solve some of the world's biggest problems while also creating value for their investors. The program is designed to provide companies with the support they need to develop their AI technology from the early stages of development through to commercialization. In addition to funding, the program will offer mentorship, events, business building, and collaboration opportunities to help the companies in the cohort to succeed. Betaworks CEO John Borthwick is optimistic about the opportunities that the new program will create. Speaking about the launch, he said, "We think that there's this enormous potential for companies in this cohort to develop transformative AI technology that can augment the way humans behave, create, play, work, and think. We're excited to see what they will come up with.". Despite the potential rewards on offer, startups interested in applying for the program will need to meet strict criteria. Betaworks is seeking companies that have a unique and innovative approach to AI and that are motivated to bring transformative technology to market. Applicants should have a clear understanding of the technical challenges involved in developing AI technology, along with a strong team and a compelling vision for how their technology can be used to help solve some of the world's biggest problems. Once the companies have been selected, they will work with Betaworks' team of experienced entrepreneurs and investors to develop their AI technology and bring it to market. They will also have the opportunity to collaborate with other companies in the cohort, share ideas and best practices, and participate in events designed to help them succeed. As the demand for AI technology continues to grow, more and more startups are seeking funding to help them bring their technology to market. Betaworks' new seed-stage AI program is designed to offer startups the support they need to succeed in developing transformative AI technology that can augment the way humans behave, create, play, work, and think. With the backing of Mozilla Ventures, Greycroft, and Differential Ventures, this new program is set to be a game-changer for early-stage AI startups looking to make an impact.
