Founders Pledge, a charitable organization based in London, has launched a new venture fund called Pledge Ventures. The fund will invest in high-growth technology companies whose founders have committed to philanthropy through Founders Pledge. Pledge Ventures has raised $38 million for its first close of funding and aims to donate 85% of carried interest and up to 50% of its management fees to Founders Pledge in order to further fund its operations, build up a long-term capital endowment, and scale its impact. Pledge Ventures has a specific focus on investing in late-stage rounds of technology companies that are raising over $20 million in a Series B or later. In addition, Pledge Ventures will only invest in companies where a top-tier fund is participating. The fund aims to create a “flywheel” effect in philanthropy by investing in socially-conscious founders who are committed to giving back. Founders Pledge was founded in 2015 by a group of technology entrepreneurs who wanted to give back to society. The organization allows founders to make a commitment to donate a portion of their personal proceeds to charity when they exit their company. According to Founders Pledge, over $2 billion has been pledged to philanthropy through the organization to date. Pledge Ventures will build on the success of Founders Pledge by investing in companies that have already made a commitment to donate to charity. By doing so, Pledge Ventures aims to create a new generation of socially-conscious entrepreneurs who will continue to give back throughout their careers. “We believe that there is a compelling business case for investing in companies where founders have made a commitment to giving back,” said James Waterworth, CEO of Founders Pledge. “These are the kinds of companies that will attract the best talent, build the strongest cultures, and innovate in ways that benefit society as a whole.”. Pledge Ventures will be led by Managing Partner Matt Mulvey, who previously served as an investor at venture capital firms including Dawn Capital and White Star Capital. Mulvey believes that Pledge Ventures has the potential to create a significant impact on the world of philanthropy. “We’re excited to be launching Pledge Ventures at a time when there is so much interest in impact investing,” said Mulvey. “Our fund will invest in companies that are not only capable of generating strong financial returns, but are also committed to making a positive impact on the world.”. Mulvey added that Pledge Ventures’ limited partners include a number of prominent entrepreneurs who have committed to donating a portion of their own proceeds to charity through Founders Pledge. The fund has also received support from a number of venture capital firms, including Atomico, Accel, and Index Ventures. “We believe that Pledge Ventures has the potential to create a virtuous cycle in which successful entrepreneurs become catalysts for impact-driven entrepreneurship,” said Tom Stafford, Managing Partner at DST Global and a supporter of Pledge Ventures. “By investing in companies that are already committed to giving back to society, Pledge Ventures can help to create a new breed of successful entrepreneurs who prioritize social impact as much as financial gain.”. Pledge Ventures is just one of several new venture funds that are focused on impact investing. According to a recent report from the Global Impact Investing Network, the assets under management in impact-focused funds have nearly doubled over the past four years, from $114 billion in 2016 to $228 billion in 2020. The report also found that impact investments have outperformed mainstream investments in multiple asset classes over the past decade. As impact investing continues to grow, Pledge Ventures aims to play a leading role in creating a new “flywheel” for philanthropy. By investing in socially-conscious companies, Pledge Ventures hopes to create a new generation of entrepreneurs who are committed to making a positive impact on society throughout their careers.
