Super.com, formerly known as Snapcommerce, has just raised $85 million in its latest funding round to boost its savings app SuperCash. The app aims to help "everyday Americans" find savings in expenditure categories such as fintech and travel, with customers collectively saving over $150 million through the cashback card and 5 million market users registered, according to CEO Hussein Fazal. Drawing inspiration from WeChat's approach in breaking into verticals to attract users, Super.com is targeting the savings app market in America with help from its newly-raised funds. The company's goal is to launch America's first savings app while developing new features for its SuperCash app and the overall platform. With the belief that Americans will always be interested in savings and discounts, Super.com has positioned itself to be the go-to place for cost-conscious millennials, especially those looking to save more money on fintech and travel expenses. As the United States slowly emerges from the COVID-19 pandemic, Super.com sees great potential in the savings app segment of the market, and it is looking to capitalize on this by offering better deals and discounts than its competitors. "We started building the next generation of savings and shopping apps three years ago with a singular mission to empower consumers everywhere to buy better," says Fazal. "The result is Super, an app that combines high-quality product searches with instant price comparisons, cashback savings, and coupons to provide an unbeatable shopping experience. Today, we're very excited to announce the raise of $85M to supercharge our growth and bring savings benefits to everyday Americans.". The SuperCash app is currently available on both iOS and Android devices, allowing users to save money on their purchases through a cashback card that can be used at a wide range of retailers. Users can also earn rewards for referring friends, and Super.com has plans to introduce additional features such as deals and coupons. Super.com's big focus is on fintech and travel expenses, allowing users to save money on services such as mobile phone bills and flights. Unlike other savings apps that might only specialize in grocery or retail coupons, Super.com believes that by offering users discounts on more significant purchases, it will create a more loyal user base and keep users coming back for more deals. "Super is the only shopping app that combines all the features you need to get the best deals in one place," says Fazal. "Our mission is to be the destination for savvy shoppers everywhere to find the best savings, cashback, and coupons on everything from mortgages to groceries.". One of the most exciting aspects of Super.com's new approach is the potential for collaboration with other fintech and travel companies. Already, the company has established partnerships with some of the biggest names in tech, such as Google and Facebook. With the additional funding from its latest funding round, Super.com has big plans to expand its reach and attract more significant corporate partners. "We're thrilled to announce this latest round of funding that will allow us to expand our offerings and continue to bring innovative solutions to our customers," says Fazal. "Our goal is to become the go-to destination for anyone looking to save money on everything from groceries to fintech services. With the support of our investors and the dedication of our team, we're confident that we can achieve that goal.". Despite all the hype surrounding Super.com's latest funding round, the company is staying humble and focused on its core mission of helping everyday Americans save money on their expenses. With a growing user base, new features, and strategic partnerships, Super.com is poised to become a leader in the savings app market in America.
