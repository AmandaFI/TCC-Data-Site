California Considers Ban on Caste Discrimination. A new bill has been introduced in the California Senate to make caste discrimination illegal. If passed, California will become the first US state to outlaw discrimination based on caste. The bill was introduced by Senator Aisha Wahab, a lawmaker from the Democratic Party, who proposed to add caste as a protected category in California's anti-discrimination laws alongside gender, race, and disability. The caste system is one of the oldest forms of social discrimination in South Asian countries, including India and Nepal. In recent years, the US tech industry has been grappling with the issue of caste discrimination. While there is opposition to the bill, supporters argue that caste discrimination needs a legislative solution. Several educational, corporate, and political institutions in California have already formulated anti-caste discrimination policies. Caste-based discrimination has been a pervasive issue in the South Asian diaspora for centuries. Even though the caste system originated in India, it has spread across the globe through migration, resulting in discrimination in countries like the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom. Caste is often used to discriminate against people in various areas of life, such as education, employment, and housing. India's caste system is a complex hierarchical system that divides society into four castes: the Brahmins (priestly class), Kshatriyas (warrior class), Vaishyas (merchant class), and Shudras (working class). Additionally, there is a fifth category known as the Dalits or the untouchables who account for 16% of the Indian population. Over the years, the caste structure has become immensely rigid and hierarchical, perpetuating a social hierarchy that has stigmatized and oppressed those at the bottom of the caste ladder. Senator Aisha Wahab said that caste discrimination is a prevalent issue in California, with people often discriminated against in education, employment, and housing. She believes that California's anti-discrimination laws should include caste as a protected category to eradicate caste-based discrimination. The bill has received support from several members of the South Asian community, who believe that it is essential to have a legislative solution to caste discrimination. The proposed bill, however, has met with opposition from some who argue that it will lead to identity politics. They believe that caste is an issue that should be left to be dealt with by the community itself. Moreover, it has also been argued that adding another category to existing anti-discrimination laws will only complicate matters and lead to confusion. The issue of caste discrimination is not new to California. Over the past few years, several incidents related to caste discrimination have come to light. A lawsuit was filed against Cisco Systems, a US tech company, in 2020 citing caste-based discrimination practices. The case involved two Indian employees who were allegedly denied promotions because of their caste. The lawsuit brought the issue of caste discrimination to the forefront, and several other tech companies also faced similar accusations. In response to the lawsuits, several companies formulated strict anti-caste policies. Google, one of the largest tech companies in the world, announced its plans to update its code of conduct to prohibit caste disclosure in the workplace. Microsoft and Oracle also issued statements condemning caste discrimination and announced their commitment to creating an inclusive workplace. Several educational institutions in California have also established anti-caste policies. The University of California, Santa Cruz, recently adopted a policy banning discrimination based on caste. The policy states that "UC Santa Cruz prohibits discrimination, harassment, and retaliation on the basis of caste category.". The bill faces a challenging process before it becomes a law. It will have to go through the committee process, where it will face scrutiny from opponents and supporters alike. If passed, it will add caste as a protected category in California's anti-discrimination laws, and anyone found guilty of caste-based discrimination will be liable to be prosecuted. Nevertheless, activists believe that the bill has set an important precedent, and a legislative solution to caste discrimination is long overdue. They argue that, while social change is important, it is not enough to combat caste discrimination. It is essential to have laws that criminalize caste discrimination, and the proposed bill is a significant step towards achieving this. The bill has garnered support not only from the South Asian community but also from several other communities. "We support the addition of caste to California's anti-discrimination laws because we believe that everyone should be treated equally, regardless of their caste, race, gender, or any other personal characteristic," said a spokesperson for Black Lives Matter. California has a history of being at the forefront of progressive legislation and social change. It was the first state to legalize same-sex marriage, and it has strict gun control laws. If the bill is passed, California will again set an example for the rest of the country to follow. In conclusion, the proposed bill has set off an important conversation about caste discrimination in the US. While there is opposition to the bill, supporters believe that it is necessary to have a legislative solution to curb caste-based discrimination. California has a unique opportunity to set a precedent and become the first US state to criminalize caste discrimination.
