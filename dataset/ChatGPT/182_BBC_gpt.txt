Beer Prices Will Have to Rise, Says Cobra Founder. Lord Bilimoria, the founder of Cobra beer, has issued a warning that prices will have to increase due to the mounting pressure of rising costs across various sectors. Inflation, interest rate rises, and tax increases have created a "vicious cycle" that is affecting virtually every business in the UK, according to Lord Bilimoria, who is also the president of the CBI employers' group. The challenging situation extends to both firms and consumers, with Tesco's chairman, John Allan, adding that food price inflation could escalate to 5% by spring, hitting the most vulnerable members of society the hardest. These concerns come at a time when UK inflation has reached a 30-year high of 5.4% and is forecasted to exceed 7% by April. Furthermore, the newly implemented price-cap rules will result in an increase in energy costs. Speaking about the current state of affairs, Lord Bilimoria highlighted that input costs, including bottling, energy, freight, and wages, have all risen significantly. In response, businesses are left with no alternative but to pass on these costs to consumers. However, Lord Bilimoria expressed his worry about the potential negative impact of planned tax increases in April, arguing that they could stifle investment and growth. Helen Dickinson, head of the British Retail Consortium, echoed Lord Bilimoria's concerns and outlined the challenges faced by businesses. Rising costs need to be passed on to customers, thereby putting an additional burden on consumers already grappling with the rising cost of living. A recent report by the Food Foundation shed further light on the extent of the challenges faced by UK households. The report revealed that in the past month, 8.8% of households, equivalent to 4.7 million adults, experienced food insecurity. This represents an increase from 7.3% in July 2021. The report emphasized the pressing need for the government to address food security as part of its levelling up agenda. As a result of these mounting pressures, the founder of Cobra beer made it clear that beer prices would have to rise to counterbalance the increased costs. The price increases would be necessary to ensure the viability of businesses and their continued ability to provide essential goods and services. The impending rise in beer prices serves as a stark reminder of the wider economic challenges facing the UK. With inflation at a 30-year high and forecasted to reach more alarming levels, consumers are likely to feel the strain on their wallets in the coming months. The burden is expected to be particularly heavy on the most vulnerable in society, as food price inflation continues to soar. In light of these circumstances, businesses across the country are calling on the government to take action. They argue for measures to address rising costs, protect businesses from the impact of tax increases, and ensure that vulnerable households have access to affordable and secure food supplies. The government's response to these calls will be crucial, as the UK grapples with the ongoing economic challenges caused by the pandemic. The need to strike a delicate balance between economic stability and protecting the most vulnerable will require careful consideration and effective action. As the founder of Cobra beer warns of the necessity for price increases, it becomes clear that businesses and consumers alike will have to bear the brunt of the mounting cost pressures. The wider implications of these challenges stretch beyond the realm of beer prices alone, emphasizing the urgency with which the UK government must address the economic burdens faced by households and businesses across the country.
