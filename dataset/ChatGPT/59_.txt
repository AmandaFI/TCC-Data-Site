Snap, the parent company of popular social media platform Snapchat, has made another big move in the augmented reality (AR) space by acquiring Paris-based startup NextMind. NextMind is renowned for its mind-controlled PC interface controller, a device that uses brain signals to control images on a computer screen. The acquisition comes shortly after NextMind announced the release of its highly anticipated $399 dev kit in the second quarter of 2020. With this purchase, Snap aims to enhance its hardware research unit, Snap Lab, and further its AR research efforts by incorporating NextMind's technology. This move aligns with Snap's ongoing efforts to innovate and stay ahead in the competitive AR market. NextMind's brain-controlled technology relies on a wearable headband equipped with an electroencephalogram (EEG) that monitors neural activity in the cortex. By detecting brain signals, NextMind's controller allows users to move images on a computer screen using their thoughts. This technology holds great potential for future Snap products, including the Spectacles AR eyewear and the Camera feature. Snap's acquisition of NextMind follows its purchase of WaveOptics, an AR headset component maker, and the announcement of the fourth-generation Spectacles, which will introduce AR capabilities to glasses. These strategic moves demonstrate Snap's commitment to driving innovation in the AR space and providing its users with the latest and most cutting-edge technology. In terms of the acquisition's impact on NextMind, the startup will continue operating in Paris, keeping its base intact. However, as part of their integration into Snap Lab, 20 of NextMind's technical employees will join Snap for long-term research and development. This collaboration will create opportunities for NextMind to contribute further to the advancement of AR technology and strengthen Snap's position as a leader in the industry. The acquisition of NextMind by Snap is a significant development that highlights the growing importance of AR technology in the social media landscape. By acquiring companies with expertise in this field, Snap aims to stay at the forefront of innovation and deliver immersive AR experiences to its users. As Snap continues to invest in research and development, users can expect exciting advancements in AR technology in the near future. With NextMind's mind-controlled PC interface controller added to Snap's arsenal, the possibilities for augmented reality experiences within the Snapchat app and its hardware products seem limitless.
