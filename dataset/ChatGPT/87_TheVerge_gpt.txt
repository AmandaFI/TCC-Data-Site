Luxury carmakers are lobbying the European Union (EU) to promote synthetic e-fuels as a solution to lowering carbon dioxide emissions from vehicles and extending the lifespan of combustion engine cars beyond the EU's previous deadline of 2035. The EU recently adopted regulations aimed at eliminating carbon dioxide emissions from new cars and vans by 2035. This radical move was made to decrease planet-heating carbon dioxide emissions from vehicles by 100%. However, an exemption in the rules was made for internal combustion engine (ICE) cars that switch out gasoline for synthetic e-fuels. E-fuels are made by combining carbon dioxide, hydrogen, and renewable energy sources. E-fuels are a solution that could potentially extend the lifespan of combustion engine cars. E-fuels are synthetic, carbon-neutral fuels that can be used in existing combustion engines without needing to modify them. Unlike fossil fuels, which emit carbon dioxide into the atmosphere during combustion, e-fuels contain carbon dioxide that's captured from the air, combined with hydrogen, and renewable energy sources such as wind or solar energy. The fuel produced can be used in any petrol or diesel engine without technical modifications. . Luxury carmakers such as Porsche, Audi, and Bentley have been lobbying the EU to promote synthetic e-fuels as a solution to reducing carbon dioxide emissions from their vehicles, arguing that these fuels would provide a greener alternative to electric vehicles. E-fuels emit less carbon dioxide in production than batteries, and combustion engines are more energy-dense and more suitable for heavy-duty applications than electric motors. The push for e-fuels has weakened the EU's plans to phase out combustion engines by 2035, raising concerns from clean energy experts. E-fuels are costly, experts argue, and making room for them in clean energy transitions would only prolong the use of gas-guzzling vehicles. E-fuels are also not as efficient as battery-electric vehicles and could result in an increase in fuel consumption and hence emissions. . The EU still has to determine how to assess whether ICE vehicles are running on e-fuels and how to ensure these fuels meet sustainability criteria. So far, some German manufacturers have started producing small batches of e-fuels, but the total amount produced is small compared to the amount of fossil fuels consumed worldwide. . The move towards e-fuels is already underway, however. Porsche is currently working on setting up an e-fuels production plant in Chile, which aims to produce 130,000 liters of fuel by 2022 and scale up to 55 million liters of synthetic gasoline annually by 2026. Audi is also investing money into e-fuels production with the aim of producing 400,000 liters a year by 2023. E-fuels could help keep combustion engine cars on the road in the EU past its 2035 climate deadline. However, experts warn that e-fuels are not a silver bullet and cannot replace battery-electric vehicles (BEVs). The production of BEVs is already increasing at a rapid pace, and the cost of producing them is falling, making them a more attractive option for consumers. . In any event, the market for e-fuels is likely to remain small, and the cost of these fuels is likely to remain high for the foreseeable future. Alternatively, the EU could incentivize cleaner fuels such as hydrogen, which is already being produced in large quantities by renewable energy sources and is suitable for both vehicles and other industrial uses. . The EU's decision to introduce regulations aimed at reducing carbon dioxide emissions from vehicles is a step in the right direction towards a cleaner and more sustainable future. However, the issue of e-fuels is one that will continue to be debated until better, more efficient solutions are found.
