Tech giant Apple has pledged to increase its use of recycled materials in its electronic devices, with the aim of using 100% recycled cobalt in the batteries it designs by 2025. This move is part of the company's wider strategy to reduce its carbon footprint and move towards a circular economy. Apple will also ensure that magnets used in its devices will contain entirely recycled rare earth elements, while circuit boards will be made using entirely recycled tin soldering and gold plating. The announcement comes after years of allegations and concerns over human rights violations in the company's supply chains, particularly in relation to the mining of key minerals such as cobalt. Apple has previously stated that it sources primary minerals responsibly, but the use of recycled materials is expected to increase transparency and reduce the environmental impact of its operations. Last year, around a quarter of all cobalt used in Apple products was sourced from recycled materials, thanks to initiatives such as its "Daisy" robot, which can disassemble iPhones to recover valuable materials. The company now aims to expand this programme to include other products and materials. In a statement, Apple's vice president of environment, policy and social initiatives, Lisa Jackson, said: "We're going to keep pushing the boundaries of what is possible with the materials in our products, and we will continue to advocate for rigorous industry standards for responsible sourcing of materials." She added that the company was "committed to finding ways to use recycled materials and other renewable resources in our products and supply chain". Apple's focus on recycled materials reflects growing concern over e-waste and the environmental impact of electronic devices. According to the UN, the world produces around 50 million tonnes of e-waste each year, with only a fifth of this being recycled. Electronic devices are among the world's fastest-growing sources of waste, and they contain a range of toxic materials that can harm both the environment and human health. Apple is not the only company to be taking action on this issue. In recent years, a number of industry players have made commitments to reducing their carbon footprint and increasing the use of recycled materials. For example, Google has pledged to use recycled materials in all of its hardware products by 2022, while Samsung aims to use recycled plastics in all of its mobile phones and home appliances by 2025. The drive towards a circular economy – in which waste is minimized, and materials are kept in use for as long as possible – is gaining traction across the business world. Alongside this, consumers are becoming increasingly aware of the environmental impact of the products they use, with many seeking out greener options. Brands that prioritize environmental sustainability and social responsibility are likely to win favor with these consumers. Apple's announcement is therefore likely to be welcomed by many, especially given the company's high profile and the potential for it to influence others in the industry. By committing to using more recycled materials in its devices, the company is taking a significant step towards a more sustainable future for the technology sector.
