Apple CEO Tim Cook has expressed excitement about the company’s growing commitment to India, as Apple prepares to open its first two retail stores in the country. In a statement, Cook announced that Apple now supports over one million developer jobs in India, and App Store payments to them have tripled since 2018. He added that the company sees India as a potential growth market and is working towards manufacturing 25% of all iPhones there by 2025. Despite being the second-largest internet market, the majority of smartphones sold in India are priced under $250. However, Apple remains optimistic about the country’s potential and is ramping up its expansion efforts. Cook is currently in India to launch the new retail stores and meet with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other business leaders. During his visit, Cook emphasised Apple’s long-standing commitment to India and said that the new retail stores mark an important milestone in the company’s history in the country. He described the stores as showcasing the best of Apple, including services such as the App Store, Apple Music and Siri. Cook also acknowledged the creativity and entrepreneurial spirit of Indian developers, who he said have helped to make the App Store such a success in the country. The opening of the new stores has been eagerly anticipated by Apple fans in India, who have often had to travel abroad to purchase the company’s products. The stores, located in Mumbai and Bangalore, will offer a range of Apple products and services, as well as in-store experiences such as Today at Apple sessions and Genius Bar support. Cook’s visit to India is also seen as an opportunity for the company to discuss its growing commitment to the country with government officials and business leaders. Apple has been working hard to build its presence in India, including by investing in its app development ecosystem and manufacturing capabilities. The company has already started manufacturing some iPhone models in India, with a view to producing 25% of all iPhones sold in the country by 2025. Speaking about the company’s efforts to expand in India, Cook said that Apple is proud to have so many talented developers in the country. He added that the company is committed to supporting their work and helping them to reach a global audience through the App Store. Cook also stressed that Apple is eager to build on its long-standing history in India and is excited about the opportunities that lie ahead for the company. The opening of the new Apple retail stores in India is a significant step for the company, which has been working to expand its presence in the country for several years. With growing smartphone adoption and demand for digital services in India, Apple sees the country as a promising growth market and is investing heavily in its future there. Cook’s visit highlights the importance of India to Apple’s global strategy, and the company’s commitment to building strong relationships with Indian developers, government officials and business leaders.
