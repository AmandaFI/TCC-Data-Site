This allows managers and administrators to track the progress of their staff in real-time, enabling them to make informed decisions about the direction of their training programs. The platform's data insights help businesses identify training needs, monitor staff engagement and activities, and improve staff retention through personalized training pathways. The funds raised in the latest funding round will be used to expand the company's global reach, with LMS365 planning to acquire distribution partners in Germany, Australia, and the US. The company has noted that this move is strategic and will help them develop a foothold in key markets. The acquisition of local partners will also allow for greater customization of the platform to meet the specific needs of regional customers.
