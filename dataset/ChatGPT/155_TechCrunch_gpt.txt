Berlin-based startup Qdrant has announced that it has raised $7.5m in seed funding. The firm aims to develop open source vector search engines and databases that can help AI developers leverage unstructured data more effectively. The money will be used to develop technology that can connect real-world data to large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4. The funding was led by Unusual Ventures and also included contributions from 42cap and IBB Ventures, along with several angel investors. Unstructured data, which includes images, videos, and text, is an increasingly important area of focus for many large enterprises as it accounts for up to 90% of the data generated today. According to Gartner, this type of data is growing three times faster than structured data. However, even with this explosive growth in unstructured data, many firms lack the tools they need to make sense of it all. Qdrant believes that its open source vector search engine and database can play a significant role in addressing this issue. The technology will help developers to effectively integrate various types of unstructured data into LLMs. This will improve the quality of insights that can be derived from this data and help firms make more informed business decisions. The company has said that its software is designed to be straightforward to use and integrate, even for those with little or no experience with AI development. The database is also highly scalable, able to handle large volumes of data with a low latency rate. The startup was founded in 2020 by a team of AI experts and data scientists who were frustrated by the limitations of existing technology in the field. They sought to create a more accessible and open-source platform that could help organizations to make the most of unstructured data. "We believe that everyone should have access to the tools they need to make use of all the data that's out there," said Andrey Doronichev, CEO of Qdrant. "Our goal is to build a platform that's easy to use and that anyone can integrate into their existing workflow. We're excited to have the support of our investors as we work to bring this vision to life.". Investors in the funding round have praised the startup for its innovative approach to tackling the issue of unstructured data. Philippe Botteri, partner at venture capital firm Accel, said: "The Qdrant team is tackling an incredibly important and challenging problem in AI development, and we're excited to support their work. The open-source approach they're taking is unique and is likely to lead to significant advances in the field.". This sentiment was echoed by Harry Weller, general partner at venture capital firm NEA, who added: "Qdrant is leveraging some of the most powerful AI technology available today to address a pressing need for businesses around the world. We believe their platform has the potential to make a real impact and are looking forward to seeing what they achieve.". Qdrant is now focused on expanding its team of developers and data scientists as it seeks to build out its platform. The startup is also planning to launch a range of new features and tools over the coming months, with the aim of making it even easier for businesses to leverage unstructured data. The company's success highlights the growing interest in open-source AI technology, which allows firms to access the latest tools and insights without having to pay expensive licensing fees. This approach is becoming increasingly popular as more businesses seek to get a better understanding of the vast amounts of data they are generating. Overall, the funding round is a positive sign for Qdrant and its ambitions to help businesses make better use of unstructured data. The startup has already demonstrated its ability to attract high-profile investors and is well-positioned to achieve further success in the months and years to come.
