In 1973, the United States government banned supersonic flights over land due to the loud sonic booms created by such flights. Since then, the aviation industry has been working to create quieter supersonic aircraft that could potentially break this ban and revolutionize air travel. In 2023, NASA and Lockheed Martin's "Skunk Works" will attempt to do just that with the X-59 Quiet SuperSonic Technology (QueSST) aircraft. The QueSST is designed to minimize the number of shockwaves coming off the aircraft as well as spreading them more widely across the airframe. The nose of the X-59 is designed to separate the shockwaves coming off the nose from those produced from the wing, which reduces the noise created. Additionally, the engines lie above the wing, which further reduces noise. The goal of the QueSST is to break the sound barrier by flying to 1,074 mph at 55,000ft without creating a loud sonic boom. If successful, this could be a game-changer for the aviation industry. The success of the QueSST could open doors for potential new supersonic passenger aircraft and aircraft industry investment. The sonic boom problem has long been a challenge for the aviation industry. Sonic booms are created when an aircraft travels faster than the speed of sound, creating a shockwave that can be heard on the ground as a loud boom. These booms can be disturbing to people on the ground and have led to bans on supersonic flights over land. The QueSST is part of NASA's X-plane program and is designed to be a quieter alternative to existing supersonic aircraft. The X-plane program aims to create a new generation of aircraft that can be more energy-efficient, environmentally friendly, and quieter than existing aircraft. The QueSST is currently in development, with the first flight expected in 2022. The aircraft is scheduled to make its first flight over a populated area in 2023, where NASA and its partners will gather data on how the aircraft's noise levels are perceived on the ground. The QueSST is a small, single-seater aircraft designed to test the technology needed to create a quiet supersonic passenger aircraft. Lockheed Martin and NASA hope that the QueSST will pave the way for a new generation of supersonic aircraft that can travel faster than existing airplanes without creating loud sonic booms. The development of a new generation of supersonic aircraft could revolutionize air travel. Today's commercial aircraft travel at speeds of around 500-600 mph, but a supersonic aircraft could travel at speeds of up to 1,000 mph or more, dramatically reducing travel times. This could make traveling across the country or even around the world much faster and more convenient than it is today. The success of the QueSST could also have a significant impact on the aircraft industry. Many aircraft manufacturers are currently working on developing their own supersonic aircraft, and the success of the QueSST could lead to increased investments in this area. This could create new jobs and drive innovation in the industry. However, there are still challenges to be addressed before supersonic passenger aircraft become a reality. In addition to creating a quiet supersonic aircraft, engineers must also address issues such as fuel efficiency, environmental impact, and safety. Despite these challenges, many in the industry are optimistic about the potential of supersonic flight. The success of the QueSST could be a major step forward in this area and could bring us closer to a new era of faster and more efficient air travel.
