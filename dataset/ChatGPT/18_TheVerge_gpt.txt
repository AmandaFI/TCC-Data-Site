Parler, the social media platform favored by far-right conservatives, experienced a brief hiatus after being purchased by Starboard, a digital media company. The move comes after Parler has faced multiple controversies since its creation in 2018, including allegations that it was used to plan the January 6th insurrection. The platform has also been pulled from multiple services, including Google Play, Amazon Web Services, and the Apple App Store, over concerns about unmoderated violent content. Parler has promised to promote "free speech," which has made it popular among far-right conservatives. However, this promise has also led to accusations that the platform promotes hate speech and extremist ideologies. In response, Parler has faced criticism and legal challenges from various groups. Despite these controversies, Parler's parent company, Parlement Technologies, has made previous attempts to sell the platform. In 2020, it was reported that Kanye West was interested in purchasing the social media platform, but the deal never materialized. Now, Parler has been sold to Starboard, and the platform will undergo a "strategic assessment." As part of this assessment, Parler will be temporarily shut down ahead of a planned relaunch. The new owner aims to address the concerns that have caused Parler to be banned from various services, such as a lack of moderation on violent content. In a press release, Starboard stated that it plans to "bring Parler back online as a platform for free speech, engagement, and content creation." The company also announced its intention to "create an open and transparent community" and to "combat the rise of cancel culture.". Starboard CEO Jeff Smith said in an interview with CNBC that the company believes "there is a huge demand for this type of social media platform." However, he added that the company also recognizes the need to address the concerns that have been raised about Parler's content. "We are evaluating all of the issues that have been raised to ensure that we have a platform that is safe and secure for everyone to use," Smith said. The news of Parler's sale and temporary shutdown has drawn mixed reactions. Some conservatives have welcomed the move, stating that Parler's lack of moderation has led to the platform becoming a haven for extremist views. Others have criticized the sale, stating that it represents censorship and an attack on the right to free speech. Regardless of these differing opinions, the sale of Parler illustrates the ongoing debates over the balance between free speech and safety online. As social media continues to play an ever-larger role in public discourse, companies and users alike will need to confront the challenges involved in ensuring that online platforms provide an inclusive and safe space for all voices.
