Smart lighting company WiZ has beaten its sister brand Philips Hue to the punch by updating its entire line of smart bulbs, lamps, and plugs manufactured in early 2021 or later to the Matter standard, making them compatible with a range of smart home platforms. The move means that WiZ products can now be integrated into Matter-compatible platforms such as Amazon Alexa, Google Home, and Samsung SmartThings, which promise better reliability and responsiveness to the bulbs and mean that they can still be controlled even if the internet is down. Previously, WiZ products were only compatible with Apple's smart home platform through Siri Shortcuts. The new WiZ v2 app allows users to migrate any compatible product to the new smart home standard directly in the app and, from there, add them to any Matter-compatible platform. WiZ's products are also a more affordable option than Philips Hue, with a full-color smart A19 bulb costing just $13. Additionally, WiZ products work over Wi-Fi and do not require a hub or bridge, unlike Hue, which uses Zigbee and relies on a bridge. WiZ may also be expanding beyond lighting, with a product image of new smart security cameras spotted on a box with three WiZ bulbs and a Matter logo. The Matter standard, previously known as Project CHIP (Connected Home over IP), is a new smart home standard backed by industry heavyweights including Amazon, Apple, Google, the Zigbee Alliance, and the Connectivity Standards Alliance (formerly known as the Zigbee Alliance). The standard is designed to make smart home devices more interoperable and easier to set up, while increasing security and privacy. The Matter standard for smart home devices is expected to launch later this year. WiZ's move to update its products to the Matter standard highlights the company's commitment to staying at the forefront of the smart home market and ensuring that its products remain accessible and compatible with a wide range of platforms. With its updated line of smart bulbs, lamps, and plugs, WiZ is poised to gain an even larger foothold in the smart home market and appeal to a broader range of customers.
