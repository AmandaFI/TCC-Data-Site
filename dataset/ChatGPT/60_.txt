Volkswagen (VW) has announced a $1.1bn investment in a new China centre for the development, innovation and procurement of fully connected electric vehicles. The 100%TechCo facility will integrate vehicles and components R&D with procurement and will be led by Volkswagen Group China's chief technology officer, Marcus Hafkemeyer. The objective is to better align with the changing needs of Chinese consumers and to shorten the development cycle of new products and technologies by roughly 30%. The centre will employ around 2,000 staff and is expected to be operational from 2024. As the world's largest EV market, China is of strategic importance to VW. Following a rocky 2015, when the automaker was forced to recall almost 680,000 vehicles due to quality issues in China, VW developed a turnaround strategy aimed at improving its brand reputation in the country. That strategy included forging new partnerships, including a $12bn tie-up with China's Anhui Jianghuai Automobile Group to develop electric and autonomous cars. The establishment of 100%TechCo marks the latest chapter in the automaker's plan to cement its place in the Chinese market. The new facility will develop "innovative concept vehicles and mobility services for China, one of Volkswagen's most important markets", said VW CEO Dr Herbert Diess. "It will further increase our capability to innovate while strengthening our position in R&D". Despite a turbulent 2020, VW has seen strong EV sales growth in China. The automaker sold almost 3.16m passenger cars in China last year, up 1.2% year-on-year. It also confirmed plans to expand its footprint in the country, especially in terms of EVs, setting a target of producing 1.5m of them in China by 2025. China's EV market is extremely competitive, with local manufacturers such as NIO, BYD and BAIC BJEV all vying for market share against established global players. Interestingly, while VW currently dominates the traditional passenger car market in China, with a 20% market share in 2020, the automaker lags behind some of its rivals in the EV segment. Nevertheless, the investment in 100%TechCo may well enable VW to close that gap. The facility will not only accelerate the development of new EVs, it will also enable the company to better understand the unique needs of Chinese consumers, including their appetite for connected vehicles. VW has been on an EV offensive in recent years, pledging to launch 70 new EVs by 2028 as part of its goal to become carbon-neutral by 2050. In November 2020, the automaker announced it was increasing its planned investment in EVs to â‚¬73bn ($86bn) over the next five years despite the pandemic. The new investment in China builds on those commitments, as the automaker continues to expand its global EV capacity. . As well as striving to increase EV sales, VW is also investing in charging infrastructure. Last year, the automaker announced plans to build six battery cell factories in Europe, the first of which will be located in Salzgitter, Germany. It is working alongside energy provider BP to deploy ultra-fast EV charging stations across Europe, with the aim of having around 18,000 charging points operational by 2025. In addition, VW has partnered with six energy firms to provide Green Energy for Mobile (GEM), an initiative aimed at giving consumers the option to choose environmentally friendly charging options. The establishment of 100%TechCo is a significant move for Volkswagen as it solidifies the automaker's footing in the world's largest EV market. With EV sales expected to continue their upward trajectory in China, VW's commitment to investing in the development of new products and technology is likely to pay off. If successful, the strategy may well enable the automaker to dominate both the traditional and EV passenger car markets in the country.
