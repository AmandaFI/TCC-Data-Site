E-commerce giant Amazon has announced its plans to cut a further 9,000 jobs, predominantly in cloud computing and advertising, in its latest bid to save costs. Following the axing of 18,000 jobs in January this year, the firm has not made it clear which countries it will be affected. The latest money-saving measures are being taken due to uncertainties about the economy and the cost of living crisis. However, this is not unique to Amazon; other tech giants are dealing with the same issues. Just last week Meta announced its plans to cut 10,000 jobs. The announcement by Amazon has caused concern for those employed within the industries mentioned, with many fearing they will be losing their jobs soon. Many of those in cloud computing and advertising roles fear that the cuts will hit them hard. The cloud computing unit is responsible for hosting data centres and providing cloud computing services for businesses and consumers alike. Meanwhile, Amazon's advertising division works with a range of brands, from start-ups to established organisations. Tech experts have suggested that the job cuts may even have an impact on the growth of the tech industry. Cloud computing, for example, is a rapidly growing industry, and these job cuts could be detrimental to such growth. Despite the worries of job cuts, Amazon has maintained that it is still very much in a strong position. The company is also keen to point out that it is committed to supporting the industry and its growth. This news comes amidst the ongoing cost of living crisis, with many families struggling to make ends meet. This has put many companies under pressure to cut costs and make savings where possible. The recent announcements by both Amazon and Meta will no doubt have a ripple effect across the industry. Many smaller companies may need to follow suit in order to stay competitive and remain profitable. Although the tech industry has long been thought of as being immune to the economic pressures of the wider world, this recent news serves as a reminder that even the biggest companies are not immune to the harsh realities of an uncertain economy.
