San Francisco-based start-up, Tavus, has announced that it has raised $6.1m in seed funding led by Sequoia, as it looks to develop its technology, using generative artificial intelligence (AI), to power a personalised video creation platform. The Tavus platform allows users to create video templates, which can be adapted for a range of customers, making it perfect for applications such as a sales executive issuing a stream of customised pitches to potential buyers, or a headhunter sending a number of tailored videos to candidates found on LinkedIn. At present, the need for mass personalisation in videos is not yet fully-recognised. However, Tavus plans on changing that perception by utilizing cutting-edge technologies such as natural language processing and generative AI which it has already utilized to develop the necessary tools that make video personalization a reality, and the logo-generation process is an example of the kind of applications Tavus sees for its AI technology. Tavus uses machine learning to train a model on facial gestures and lip movements, and is able to realistically mimic these movements by voice. The company's most notable AI-enabled feature is its natural-sounding text-to-speech algorithm that it claims can clone anyone's voice with just a single audio file, enabling it to deliver a highly personalised audiovisual experience. Commenting on the platform, Luc Favret, co-founder of Tavus, said: "We're looking to replicate what mass-marketing software has been doing in email and bring it to the more visually-engaging world of videos. Because of machine learning, we've reached a level of customization that wasn't possible before". Favret added: "We believe that our voice and facial recognition capabilities put us in a unique position, positioned right at the intersection of artificial intelligence and marketing technology". Tavus offers a range of features and variables such as video length, preferred voice and facial structure, and hair colour. The platform is able to deliver anything from a short animated explainer video with text-to-speech voiceover and basic brand elements, all the way to a fully-fledged, live-action video with full AI-based cloning of a voice, and face, with a variety of customisations and animations. The start-up sees a future in which their technology will become more mainstream, personalisation of marketing will become more critical and eventual customers will actively demand the ability to create highly personalised video content. Tavus' technology combines the skills of video editing, graphic design, and software programming. The company's "Personalized Visual Experience" approach has begun to gain traction with users seeking customized, on-brand visuals that incorporate personalised messaging. The Tavus platform uses natural language processing to map a customer's messaging to the appropriate visuals, connecting the brand with the customer in personalized marketing videos. To support this personalised marketing trend, Tavus envisions a future where the ability to easily and quickly create customized video content will become a core business asset. The company's technology can provide customers with an edge by delivering personalised videos that engage with customers in a way that traditional marketing cannot. Tavus sees its technology as a step forward in natural language processing techniques, which are the key to personalised communication. With the platform, customers can create videos that sound natural and human-like, ensuring that the message comes across. The Tavus platform is constantly developing, and the company is looking to add more advanced features in the coming months. One of the key features that the company is pursuing is the ability to add more AI-based features into its video creation process. This could include everything from real-time object recognition to incorporating data from customer feedback into a video creation. "We're on the cusp of something big," Favret said. "Our platform has already proven that it can deliver personalised video at scale. With our AI offering, we believe we're positioned to lead this market forward". Personalised marketing is a rapidly-growing trend, with more and more businesses seeking to engage with customers on a more human level. By leveraging AI technology, Tavus is able to help companies embrace this trend, by creating highly-customised, visually-engaging video experiences that will capture the attention of customers and help businesses stand out in an ever-crowded marketplace.
