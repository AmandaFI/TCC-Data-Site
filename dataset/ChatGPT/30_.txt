Enzo Steenkamp, a 37-year-old from South Gloucestershire, was left in "complete shock" after his Mercedes C-Class Coup√© was stolen by criminals using keyless technology. The incident only took 20 seconds, as captured on CCTV footage, and has left Steenkamp questioning the safety of high-end vehicles. "I had only bought my dream car two months ago and to have it stolen so quickly and easily is a terrible feeling," Steenkamp said. "I thought I had done everything to protect it, but clearly not. I hope the police can catch these criminals and prevent other people from going through what I have.". Avon and Somerset Police have issued a warning to owners of high-end vehicles that they are being targeted by criminals using relay technology. The force suspects that the stolen cars are either being sold for parts or used in further criminal activity across the country. Since January, the area has seen a sharp increase in keyless thefts. The police are advising car owners to take extra precautions to protect their vehicles, including parking in well-lit areas and using security devices such as steering wheel locks or immobilisers. Detective Inspector Gavin Pryce said: "These are highly-organised criminals who are using sophisticated technology to steal cars. They work in teams of two, with one standing near the targeted vehicle with a relay device and the other standing near the house with another device to pick up the signal and unlock the car. By the time the owner realises their car has been stolen, the criminals are long gone.". He added: "We are doing everything we can to crack down on these crimes, but we need the public's help. If you have any information about these thefts or see anyone acting suspiciously in your area, please contact us.". Steenkamp's case has highlighted the need for car manufacturers to improve the security of keyless entry systems. Thieves can use devices to amplify the signal from a car's key fob, even if it is inside the owner's house, to unlock the vehicle and drive it away. The issue has already caught the attention of the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), which has warned car manufacturers that they must improve the security of their entry systems to avoid putting motorists at risk. In a recent report, the NCSC stated that the keyless entry system was "inherently vulnerable" and that manufacturers needed to explore alternatives. Steenkamp has called on Mercedes to do more to protect their customers. "I hope car manufacturers take note of these thefts and start investing in better security measures. No one should have to go through what I have," he said. As the police continue their investigations into the thefts, car owners are being urged to take extra precautions with their vehicles. Keyless thefts are on the rise, and unless manufacturers improve the security of their entry systems, owners may continue to find themselves targeted by sophisticated criminals.
