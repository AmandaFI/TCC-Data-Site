Billionaire investor, Vinod Khosla, has revealed that Indian start-ups with strong fundamentals will continue to be funded despite investor exuberance waning. Khosla is the founder of technology company Sun Microsystems and has a reputation for funding several Silicon Valley start-ups. Khosla has stated that he anticipates that the tightening of capital will have a positive long-term impact. Khosla warns, however, that valuations on offer to Indian start-ups will be lower due to inflation and changing investor sentiment. This could lead to a triage of sorts, where the wheat will be separated from the chaff, and "not-so-good Indian start-ups will not get funded and go bust this year". The investor believes that technology has driven major parts of US GDP growth and defined the country's global competitiveness, and that India offers a similar opportunity with supportive government policies. Speaking to reporters at a conference in Bengaluru, Khosla said "I do think there will be a fall in valuations in India, which happened in Silicon Valley last year, and that will be a good thing." He went on to say, "I think this is the year of reckoning, when many not-so-good Indian start-ups will not get funded, and go bust this year.". Despite the tightening of capital, Khosla is optimistic that there will be positive long-term effects. "I think, in the long-term, there will be less exuberance and less silly funding. But overall, I think it’s a good thing. I think if the valuations come down, more building will happen, rather than more cash being spent.". Khosla believes that supportive government policies are helping India in this regard. "I think the government is realising the importance of technology in the future of India" he said. "I’ve always believed that the Indian bureaucracy was the bottleneck to the country's progress, and now I’m seeing bureaucrats embracing technology for the first time.". However, Khosla warned that investors will have to be more cautious due to the high degree of fraud in India. "There are a lot of fraudulent companies in India, so you have to be very diligent," he stated. "You’ve got to be really careful about how you invest, and that’s the big challenge in India.". Khosla's comments come after Indian start-ups had a banner year in 2015, raising over $8 billion in funding – a record amount. However, this year has seen a tightening of capital as investors become more cautious. In March, Ratan Tata, the former chairman of Tata Sons, warned of an upcoming bloodbath in the Indian start-up scene, stating "In my personal opinion, there will be a shake-out in the sector this year", similar to what happened in the US last year. Khosla believes that this tightening of funding will have a positive effect in the long run. "The less easily money is available, the more disciplined companies become," he said. "I think the tighter policies will reduce the number of not-so-good start-ups, and that’s a good thing.". Despite the tighter policies, Khosla believes the Indian start-up scene has a bright future. "There’s always going to be a few challenges, but I think there’s a huge opportunity in India," he said. "I think Indian start-ups have the potential to be as successful as Silicon Valley start-ups.". Khosla has been involved in the Indian start-up scene for some time now, and has a number of investments in India. In 2013, his investment firm Khosla Ventures invested in payments start-up, Stripe, which has since grown to become one of the most successful payments companies in the world. The investor is known for investing in companies with innovative business models, such as open-source software and online education, and has a reputation for backing companies that take on traditional business models. Khosla has been a vocal advocate for clean tech and has invested heavily in sustainable energy start-ups. India has been touted as a potential hotbed for innovation in recent years, with an increasing number of start-ups reaching record-high valuations. However, as we have seen in the US in recent months, this exuberance can be fleeting, and investors are becoming more selective about where they put their money. Despite these challenges, Khosla is optimistic that the Indian start-up scene will continue to thrive. "I’m excited about the future of India," he said. "The world needs more competition, and India can provide that. Whether it’s through the technology sector or otherwise, I think India has a huge amount of potential.".
