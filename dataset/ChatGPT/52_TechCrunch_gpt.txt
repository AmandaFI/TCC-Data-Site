At Just 2.1% of all VC Investment Funding for Women Remains ‘Meh’ in Q1 2023. According to the latest industry data, female founders continue to face significant hurdles when it comes to securing investment funding. In the first quarter of 2023, all-female founding teams raised only 2.1% of the estimated $37 billion invested in U.S. startups. This represents a year-over-year decline of 53% from the same period in 2022. Undoubtedly, the economic volatility, geopolitical upheaval, and poor performance of tech stocks are major contributors to this dismal state of affairs. Mixed-gender teams also saw their venture totals decline on a year-over-year basis, raising $7 billion in Q1 2023, compared to $15.8 billion in Q1 2022. However, it is not all bad news for mixed-gender teams. They are actually faring better than ever in terms of their share of all venture dollars, raising 18.9% of the capital invested so far this year in U.S. startups. As the year progresses, this share may change based on the amount of capital invested in mixed-gender teams and venture aggregates themselves. It is evident that the data on venture dollars raised is a useful metric, but an incomplete one. It is also important to know how many deals were struck in total and by whom. In terms of the bigger picture, the number of deals struck in the first quarter of 2023 decreased by 31% year-over-year, reaching 1,863. This reduction in deal-making is somewhat expected given the challenging economic environment. Despite the overall decline in investment in the first quarter of 2023, some individual companies still managed to attract significant funding. For example, FinTech firm X-Change raised $250 million in a Series D funding round led by venture capital firms Andreesen Horowitz and Bessemer Venture Partners. This substantial investment reflects the continued interest in disruptive financial technologies, but also highlights the challenges faced by other companies, particularly those founded by women. The persistent disparities in funding levels for female-founded companies is a topic of ongoing discussion in the industry. Initiatives such as the female-led investment groups All Raise and Portfolia aim to increase investment in women-led businesses, but progress is slow. As industry leaders continue to push for greater diversity and inclusivity, it remains to be seen whether the investment landscape will change in the coming months and years.
