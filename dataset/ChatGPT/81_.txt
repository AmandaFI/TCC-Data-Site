Netflix, the popular streaming platform, is venturing into the gaming industry with the development of a cloud gaming service. The company's Vice President of External Games, Leanne Loombe, revealed that the initiative was geared towards making Netflix games more accessible to users across different devices.  . During a recent press briefing, Loombe stated that the service would allow gamers to enjoy Netflix games on any screen. This new development would eliminate the hassle of downloading games on different devices since the games would be playable on "every Netflix device that you have." Cloud gaming would enable frictionless accessibility to gaming experiences by making titles more mobile and accessible on any platform, providing users with seamless gameplay. While Netflix has already begun early-stage development of the service in their mobile games, Loombe admits that the current mechanism is clunky and not as effective as playing games in an app. The cloud gaming service addresses this issue by allowing Netflix games to be played on multiple platforms, depending on the user's preference. Loombe believes that this will enhance users' gaming experiences and make Netflix games more accessible to users around the globe. Netflix has been quietly developing its gaming service for some time now. Earlier in the year, the company disclosed it was looking to hire a head of gaming to lead its gaming department. The service is expected to strengthen Netflix's position in the entertainment industry and attract new customers to the streaming platform. Netflix joins other tech giants, such as Google and Microsoft, who have already dabbled in cloud gaming. Google launched its cloud gaming service, Stadia, in November 2019, while Microsoft released Xbox Cloud gaming in September 2020. However, Netflix's focus will initially be on mobile games before expanding its services to other platforms. The announcement by Netflix comes amid growing demand for gaming services worldwide, with the industry projected to be worth over $300 billion by 2025. The gaming industry has seen increased attention during the COVID-19 pandemic, with more people turning to gaming as a source of entertainment during lockdowns. As the gaming industry continues to thrive, it is expected that more streaming platforms, including Netflix, may venture into the gaming industry. In conclusion, the move by Netflix into cloud gaming is expected to transform the entertainment industry and offer users more options in gaming. The company's development of a cloud gaming service will eliminate the need to download different games on multiple devices and provide frictionless access to gaming experiences on any screen. This new development is set to be a win-win for avid gamers using Netflix, who will now have access to an array of games playable on any platform.
