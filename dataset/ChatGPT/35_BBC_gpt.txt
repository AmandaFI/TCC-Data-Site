Heart disease is one of the biggest killers in the world, but researchers at the University of Washington are using the technology in smartphones to help detect the disease early and accurately. Lidar sensors, which are commonly used for measuring distances on autonomous vehicles, are being applied in a completely different way to measure the coagulation of blood. Researchers have discovered that Lidar sensors can detect whether a single drop of blood has clotted or not using speckle patterns. The technology works by using Lidar sensors to produce light waves which scatter around the blood drop. The vibrations of the blood drop move at different rates depending on whether the blood clots or not, meaning that the scattered light waves create unique speckle patterns for each type of blood. By relying entirely on the smartphone's native hardware, this type of ground-breaking technology eliminates the need for samples to be taken to a lab or hospital, greatly reducing the cost and increasing the speed of diagnosis. The team at the University of Washington is not the only group of researchers exploring smartphone technology to measure heart health. Scientists in China have developed deep learning algorithms that can detect a range of physical signs and symptoms that are associated with heart disease. These include facial wrinkles, creases and imperceptible changes in facial blood flow detected through self-shot videos. By harnessing Deep Learning techniques, researchers are exploring ways to measure the risk of heart disease by analyzing hundreds of thousands of images that have been collected from people around the world. Innovation in this area is not just limited to blood tests and facial recognition, however. American start-up Riva has created a sensor that tracks a person's blood pressure using the camera built into their smartphone. The sensor works by essentially turning the smartphone's camera and flash into a three-dimensional scanner, which captures images of the blood vessels in the finger. The Riva sensor then uses machine learning algorithms to evaluate the pressure inside the finger, giving an accurate reading of blood pressure. These technologies are still in experimental phases and are being refined as we speak, but itâ€™s clear that the potential for smartphone technology to revolutionize our understanding of heart disease is vast. Speaking to journalists, Professor of Cardiovascular Medicine at the University of Newcastle, Jeremy Pearson, explained that these technologies would represent a huge shift in the way heart disease is diagnosed. "It would be particularly useful in hospitals in developing countries" he said, "where access to sophisticated laboratory testing facilities are limited.". However, these innovative technologies, still in their infancy, also come with concerns. Many people feel uneasy as AI and technology increasingly becomes an integral part of our health care services. Part of this uneasiness is based on concerns of accuracy and the small risk of misdiagnosis. Some also feel concern about the large amounts of data that will be collected during use and what will be done to keep this data safe. There is a need for transparency and clear guidelines surrounding the usage of a person's health data as they get generated on these new health tech platforms. However, if smartphones can provide people with a way to monitor their heart health without the need for costly hospital tests, then the benefits would be clear. With the popularity of smartphones constantly increasing, experts feel that the implications of integrating smartphones into heart health diagnosis could be vast. With heart disease being such a silent killer, early detection is key to preventing the development of the disease. The emergence of these new technologies could literally save millions of lives around the world. The future of health care tech is looking bright.
