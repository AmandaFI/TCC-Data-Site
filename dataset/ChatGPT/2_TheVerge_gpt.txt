Gamers and fans of Counter-Strike 2 will soon be able to enjoy a game with even smoother and more responsive graphics, thanks to the infusion of Nvidia's highly acclaimed latency-reducing Reflex technology. The new and highly anticipated game, which is set to replace Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, is expected to take advantage of the technology in order to enhance the competitive shooter experience. While Reflex is particularly crucial for competitive gamers who rely on quick responses and real-time actions, the technology has been incorporated into a variety of games in recent years, with its benefits being lauded by players and reviewers alike. In fact, with the inclusion of Reflex in Counter-Strike 2, nine out of the top 10 competitive shooters now have the Nvidia technology, leaving just PUBG lacking support. Players with a GeForce GTX 900 series GPU or better will be able to experience the benefits of the technology when playing the upcoming game, with those using older GPUs likely to see the biggest improvements. The technology has the potential to reduce system latency by up to 35%. "This technology is exciting for gamers and we're thrilled to see it being brought to Counter-Strike 2," said an Nvidia spokesperson. "We anticipate that it will make the experience even more immersive and exciting, particularly for those who love competitive shooters. We're excited to see what players think once they've had a chance to try it for themselves.". The announcement of Reflex's integration into Counter-Strike 2 was made at a recent event, where Nvidia also showcased its new and as yet unannounced RTX 4070. While not much is known about the upcoming graphics card, rumours suggest it may deliver even better performance than its predecessors and will likely be a popular choice for gamers seeking top-of-the-line hardware. With the countdown to Counter-Strike 2's release continuing, fans and gamers alike can rest assured that the upcoming game will be packed with high-performance features and the latest technology, designed to make it the best first-person shooter experience of 2022 and beyond.
