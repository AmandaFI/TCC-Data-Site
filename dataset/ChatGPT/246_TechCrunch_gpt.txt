Steer Tech, a Maryland-based AV technology company, has received $1.5 million in funding from the North Central Texas Council of Governments to create a test bed at the Dallas Fort Worth (DFW) International Airport. The project aims to develop an automated parking ecosystem that can alleviate traffic and congestion in the airport's curbside drop-off and pick-up areas. The pilot project, which is set to run for over a year, will combine low-speed vehicle automation for valet parking, supervisory parking management, and active digital curb management. Ten test vehicles equipped with Steer's AV software and sensor suite will be utilized for the project. One of the key goals of the project is to open-source Steer's valet parking APIs. This will promote interoperability between different digital curb management companies, parking management companies, and Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs). By doing so, Steer aims to facilitate the adoption of valet parking and foster the development of a comprehensive ecosystem. Automated valet parking has the potential to greatly enhance the efficiency of parking at airports. With Steer's technology, passengers will no longer need to spend excessive time circling around the airport looking for a parking spot. Instead, they can simply drop off their vehicle at the curbside and allow Steer's automated system to park it for them. This will not only save time for passengers but also reduce congestion in crowded parking lots. The partnership between Steer and DFW airport is expected to have a significant impact on the future of parking management. The successful implementation of the pilot project could serve as a blueprint for other airports and parking facilities around the world. Furthermore, the integration of Steer's technology into the DFW airport will enhance the overall customer experience. Passengers will no longer need to worry about finding a parking spot or maneuvering their vehicles in tight spaces. Instead, they can rely on Steer's automated system to take care of these tasks. DFW airport is one of the busiest airports in the United States, with millions of passengers passing through its gates every year. The implementation of an automated parking system will not only improve the overall flow of traffic but also reduce carbon emissions associated with circling around the airport in search of parking. The partnership between Steer and DFW airport highlights the growing importance of automation in transportation. As technology continues to advance, automated systems are becoming more prevalent in various aspects of our lives. From self-driving cars to automated parking, these technologies have the potential to greatly enhance efficiency, reduce congestion, and improve the overall customer experience. With the funding from the North Central Texas Council of Governments, Steer is set to make significant progress in the development of its automated parking ecosystem. The pilot project at DFW airport will serve as a testing ground for the company's technology and provide valuable insights for future implementations. As airports continue to face challenges related to traffic and congestion, the adoption of automated valet parking could provide a viable solution. With Steer's technology and the support of the North Central Texas Council of Governments, DFW airport is poised to become a leader in the implementation of automated parking systems.
