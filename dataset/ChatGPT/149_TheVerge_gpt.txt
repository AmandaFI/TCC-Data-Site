Microsoft may be preparing to take on Nvidia with their own AI chips. According to reports, the tech giant has been secretly developing its own chips, codename Athena, since 2019. The chips are being created to train large language models and could allow Microsoft to cut costs by avoiding reliance on Nvidia's costly technology. Although it is unclear whether Microsoft will offer the chips to their Azure cloud customers, employees have already begun testing them. The development of these chips is a significant move for Microsoft, as it could potentially allow them to compete with Nvidia, which is currently the leader in the AI chip market. Microsoft's current reliance on Nvidia technology has given the company a significant market share, but it has also made them vulnerable to rising costs from Nvidia. The Athena chips are expected to be available to Microsoft and OpenAI as early as next year. The company has also reportedly begun planning multiple future generations of the chips. This suggests that Microsoft is committed to developing its own AI chips and could eventually be able to rival Nvidia's offerings. Microsoft has been working on ARM-based chips for years and has already collaborated with AMD and Qualcomm on custom chips for its Surface devices. This expertise in developing custom chips allows the company to potentially create powerful, cost-effective AI chips that can compete with Nvidia's high-end offerings. This news could potentially shake up the AI chip market, as Microsoft's entry could disrupt Nvidia's current dominance. It would also provide more options for companies looking for AI chips, which could lead to lower costs across the market. While it remains to be seen how successful the Athena chips will be, Microsoft's investment in the technology is a clear indication that the company is committed to advancing artificial intelligence research. This could lead to exciting new developments in the field, as AI becomes more accessible and affordable for researchers and developers around the world.
