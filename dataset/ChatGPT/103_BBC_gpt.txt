Twitter's blue tick restored to high profile accounts. Twitter is the latest social media platform to return its verification system to the public eye. The platform has announced that it is reinstating the blue tick badges of some accounts with over one million followers without requiring payment. Initially, the blue tick was a free badge of verification intended to combat fake accounts and misinformation, but now it is a symbol of an account having subscribed to premium service Twitter Blue. The price of the subscription varies according to location but is approximately $8 per month. Twitter was criticised in 2017 for turning the blue tick into a perk for celebrities, after it was revealed that the verification process had been closed to the public. The platform responded by relaunching the verification system in 2018, but the system was again criticised for being unfair and slow. Now, with the return of the blue tick to high profile accounts, Twitter hopes to increase the value of the badge as a sign of legitimacy. Celebrities including Beyonc√©, Richard Osman, Victoria Beckham, and Harry Kane have had their blue ticks reinstated along with the BBC News Twitter account. Of these accounts, the BBC News Twitter account was not required to pay for the service. In a statement, Twitter said: "We're committed to ensuring the accuracy and integrity of information on Twitter, which is why we're prioritising the verification of accounts with the highest levels of engagement and potential for impact.". The move has been met with mixed response from Twitter users, with some questioning why high profile public figures need to be verified on Twitter, while others have expressed concern about the rise in celebrities using social media to promote their own brand rather than sharing information with the public. Twitter has also faced criticism for the way in which it handles harassment and misinformation on its platform, with many users calling for stricter regulation. The platform has responded by introducing new features to limit the spread of misinformation and hate speech, but has been criticised for not going far enough. Twitter has said that it will continue to work on improving its platform and reducing the spread of harmful information. "We believe that it is important for Twitter to be a place where people can express themselves freely and without fear of retaliation," the platform said in a statement. The return of the blue tick is just one of a number of changes that Twitter has introduced in recent years as it seeks to maintain its relevance in the social media landscape. The platform has also introduced new features such as voice tweets and audio spaces, which allow users to discuss topics in real time with a small group of people. Overall, Twitter's move to return its blue tick verification system to high profile accounts has been met with mixed reactions from users. While some have welcomed the return of the badge as a sign of legitimacy, others have questioned the value of the badge for public figures, and have expressed concerns about the rise of celebrity promotion on social media. Twitter will continue to work to improve its platform and to combat misinformation and hate speech, as it seeks to maintain its relevance in the ever-changing world of social media.
