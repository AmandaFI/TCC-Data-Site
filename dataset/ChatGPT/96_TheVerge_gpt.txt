LG has introduced a new addition to its popular Gram line of laptops, the LG Gram Style, with an eye-catching, color-changing finish that appeals to younger, more style-conscious buyers. The laptop comes in 14-inch and 16-inch sizes and weighs a mere 2.2 pounds (999 grams). The unique feature of the laptop is its non-delineated haptic trackpad that illuminates with LEDs. Although this feature may not enhance the user experience, it certainly adds to the aesthetic value of the device. . At CES 2023, LG showcased other fun designs, including polka dots and colorful finishes, in an attempt to appeal to a younger audience. Other companies have also introduced non-traditional visuals and designs to keep up with this trend. LG expects that the Gram Style will not compete with mainstream competitors such as the MacBook Air, but it aims to expand the reach of the franchise. According to LG, the Gram Style's iridescent, color-changing finish gives it a unique identity. The finish ranges from silvery-white to blueish to orange, depending on the lighting. The company has also made sure that the laptop is lightweight without compromising on performance. LG has used a combination of magnesium and nano carbon materials, which provides a durable yet lightweight product. . The LG Gram Style has a long-lasting battery life of up to 21.5 hours, making it a perfect choice for professionals and students who need to work for extended periods. The laptop is powered by Intel's 11th Gen Intel Core processors, which provide a seamless multitasking experience. The device also runs on Windows 11, which gives users access to innovative features. . The laptop has a non-delineated haptic trackpad that eliminates the need for physical buttons. Instead, users can press anywhere on the surface to trigger an action. The haptic feedback and LED illumination enhance the unique look of the laptop. The keys on the keyboard are backlit, which makes typing in low light conditions a breeze. . The LG Gram Style also features a full HD IPS display with a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels that produces clear and vivid images. The display has a narrow bezel, which maximizes the screen-to-body ratio. The laptop also has a Thunderbolt 4 port that supports data transfer speeds of up to 40Gbps, making it easy to transfer large files. . The LG Gram Style is available for purchase, with a starting price of $1,499. While this may seem expensive, LG is marketing the Gram Style towards a niche audience that values style and design, coupled with performance and functionality. The Gram Style is not meant to be a direct competitor to the MacBook Air; instead, it aims to carve out its own space in the market as a stylish and lightweight device that still offers impressive performance. . In conclusion, the LG Gram Style is a unique, stylish device that offers impressive performance and functionality. The laptop's iridescent, color-changing finish is sure to turn heads and appeal to the younger, more style-conscious audience. While it may not compete with mainstream competitors, LG is hoping to expand the reach of the Gram franchise with this latest addition.
