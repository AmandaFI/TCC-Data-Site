Singapore-based startup Accredify has secured $7m in a Series A funding round, co-led by iGlobe Partners and SIG Venture Capital, alongside Qualgro and Pavilion Capital, to accelerate the growth of its document verification platform that uses blockchain technology. Founded by Quah Zheng Wei, Accredify offers a secure and tamper-proof system for verifying documents such as educational diplomas and certificates, healthcare records, corporate registries, and others, meaning people or institutions can ensure the authenticity of the documents they are presented with. The platform leverages blockchain to encrypt and store documents, giving users access to verified data that is both secure and reliable. Wei left his career as a chartered accountant to learn how to code and explore blockchain technology, an endeavor that has now proved lucrative. “Our platform offers a secure way of sharing verified data, empowering users to own and control their data and share it how they choose. With blockchain technology underpinning the platform, we’re able to offer a tamper-proof system that ensures documents are genuine and trustworthy,” said Wei. The platform has processed 12 million verifications on two million documents and has already served more than 600 users, according to the company. The latest funding will enable Accredify to expand its reach and offer its services to more people and organizations. It also plans to develop new products and services that use blockchain technology to help improve the transparency and security of document verification. “The blockchain has enormous potential to make our world more secure, transparent, and accountable,” said Wei. “We’re excited to be at the forefront of this change, and are grateful for the support of our investors, who share our belief in the transformative power of blockchain.”. Accredify is not the first company to employ blockchain to reliably and securely verify documents. Several companies, including VeriBlock and University of Nicosia, have launched similar platforms, aiming to improve the efficiency of document verification and prevent fraud. Nevertheless, the market for document verification is still small and highly fragmented, which means there is significant potential for new products and services that offer enhanced security and transparency. The platform is also expected to have applications beyond traditional documents verification, such as authentication for digital identities and the secure sharing of personal data, which could be useful for industries such as finance, education, and healthcare. “The potential for blockchain to transform the way we manage data is enormous, and we believe Accredify is perfectly placed to take advantage of this opportunity,” said iGlobe Partners’ CEO Thomas Ng. “Accredify’s team has an in-depth understanding of the technology, and a vision for how it can be used to create a more secure and transparent world. We’re proud to support their efforts to bring this vision to life.”.
