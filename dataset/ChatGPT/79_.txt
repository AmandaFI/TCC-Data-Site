Google has announced a new initiative to entice its employees back to the office: free electric scooters. The tech giant has partnered with e-scooter maker Unagi to launch the "Ride Scoot" program, providing an innovative solution for commuting to work or the closest bus stop. Under this program, most US-based Google employees will be eligible for a monthly reimbursement for a subscription to Unagi's Model One scooter. This lightweight dual-motor scooter boasts a top speed of 20mph and a range of 15.5 miles, making it an ideal choice for urban commuting. Google's investment in expanding its office space during the pandemic shows its belief in the return of in-person work. To encourage employees to embrace this new working model, Google is willing to spend money on perks such as offering free scooters. By partnering with Unagi, a company that has raised over $10 million in venture capital funding, Google is ensuring a reliable and high-quality product for its employees. Google employees will have the option to sign up for a discounted monthly scooter subscription through booths set up at Google offices. The subscription fee of $44.10 per month, along with a $50 enrollment fee, will be fully reimbursed by Google. This added benefit will also be integrated into Google's internal employee portal, making it easily accessible to all employees. To give employees a chance to test out the Model One scooter, Unagi will be hosting demo days at Google offices. This hands-on experience will allow employees to get a feel for the scooter's features and performance. Additionally, employees will need to use the scooter for at least nine commutes per month in order to qualify for full reimbursement. Unagi has also struck deals with other companies, such as Salesforce, to offer electric scooters as a transportation perk for their employees. Furthermore, Unagi is working with hotels and residences to place their scooters in lobbies, providing convenient mobility options for guests and residents alike. This new partnership between Google and Unagi reflects a growing trend in transportation alternatives for commuters. Electric scooters have gained popularity in recent years due to their ease of use, affordability, and eco-friendliness. With the Ride Scoot program, Google is not only encouraging employees to embrace sustainable transportation options but also promoting a more active lifestyle. As more and more companies adapt to the post-pandemic work landscape, offering innovative transportation perks like free electric scooters can be a powerful incentive to bring employees back to the office. Google's investment in expanding office spaces and providing these unique benefits demonstrates its commitment to fostering an engaging and collaborative work environment. With the Ride Scoot program and its partnership with Unagi, Google is taking a step further in enhancing the employee experience and embracing the future of commuting. The initiative combines convenience, sustainability, and technology to provide a solution that is both practical and appealing for Google employees. As Google continues to prioritize the health and well-being of its employees and adapts to the evolving work environment, initiatives like the Ride Scoot program demonstrate its dedication to creating a positive and forward-thinking workplace culture. By embracing modern transportation solutions, Google is shaping the future of commuting, one electric scooter at a time.
