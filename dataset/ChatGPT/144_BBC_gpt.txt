Europe agrees new law to curb Big Tech dominance. European lawmakers have reached an agreement on new rules aimed at curbing the dominance of Big Tech companies such as Google and Apple. Under the proposed Digital Markets Act (DMA), these tech giants would be required to open up their services and platforms to other businesses, as they have long faced criticism for using their market dominance to stifle competition. The move is the EU's largest regulatory action against what it deems as anti-trust or anti-competitive behavior from mainly US technology firms. The proposed DMA would enforce various changes on these companies. One example is that Apple would have to allow third-party payment options in its App Store, a demand that is currently being contested by Epic Games in the US. Google would be asked to offer alternatives to its search engine, Google Maps app, and Chrome browser on smartphones running its Android operating system. Apple would also need to allow users to uninstall its Safari web browser and other pre-installed apps that are currently non-removable. The scope of the law would cover major services like WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, iMessage, the App Store, Google Play, and others belonging to large tech firms. The objective is to give users more choice in how they send messages and require technology firms to make their messaging services interoperable with smaller competitors. While the DMA is aimed at increasing competition and consumer choice, Apple expressed concern that some provisions could undermine user privacy and security. Google, on the other hand, supports the ambitions of the DMA but worries that certain rules could limit innovation and options for European users. The law will only apply to companies with a value exceeding €75 billion ($92 billion), annual sales surpassing €7.5 billion ($9.2 billion), and no less than 45 million monthly users. European Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, who proposed the legislation in response to what she perceived as monopolistic behavior by Big Tech, stated that "the gatekeepers" must now take responsibility. Once implemented, the DMA will grant unprecedented authority to Brussels in regulating major tech companies. The agreement now awaits final votes in the European Parliament as well as by ministers from the EU's 27 member states. This move comes as several bills are being considered in the US Congress to rein in the power of Big Tech, indicating a global trend toward greater scrutiny and regulation of these companies. The DMA has been praised by advocates for more competition in the tech industry. Critics argue that the dominance of Big Tech companies has stifled innovation and limited consumer choice. By forcing these companies to open up their services and platforms to other businesses, the DMA aims to level the playing field and introduce more competition into the market. However, concerns have been raised about potential privacy and security implications of the new law. Companies like Apple, which prioritize user privacy, worry that some provisions could undermine the security measures they have in place. On the other hand, Google supports the goals of the DMA but has concerns about potential limitations on innovation and options for European users. The DMA is part of a larger global trend of increased scrutiny and regulation of Big Tech companies. In the US, multiple bills are currently being considered in Congress to address the market dominance of these tech giants. If approved, the DMA will mark a significant shift in power and authority to regulate major tech companies to the European Union. Brussels will have the ability to enforce changes and ensure fair competition in the tech industry. The proposed law is now awaiting final votes in the European Parliament and approval from ministers of the EU member states. If passed, it could set a precedent for other jurisdictions to take similar actions in curbing the dominance of Big Tech companies.
