Spotify, the popular music streaming service, has announced the closure of its founding podcast studio, Studio 4, leading to layoffs for some employees. The studio, consisting of around 10 to 15 employees, was responsible for producing notable shows such as Dissect and Chapo: Kingpin on Trial. The affected employees received calls on Friday, informing them that their last day would be January 21st. Spotify also stated that they would receive two months of severance pay. Some employees were given new roles within the company, while others were directed to the Spotify job board. Gina Delvac, the head of Studio 4, was among those let go. However, Spotify declined to comment further on the matter. In a note to Spotify staff, obtained by The Verge, Julie McNamara, head of US studios and video, acknowledged the layoffs and explained that shutting down Studio 4 would enable the company to move faster, make more progress, and foster better collaboration within the organization. Studio 4, also known as Spotify Studios, was the first podcasting studio created by Spotify. Although it rarely received media attention, it was occasionally mentioned in Spotify's earnings reports. The studio focused on music, artists, celebrity deals, and influencer-hosted content. However, employees felt that Studio 4 did not receive the same recognition and support as the other three podcasting networks acquired by Spotify, namely Parcast, Gimlet, and The Ringer. One affected employee stated that the lack of clear initiatives for Studio 4 made it challenging for the team to prove its success and gain recognition within the company. Since the establishment of Studio 4, Spotify has acquired several other studios and secured deals with popular podcasting personalities, while also focusing on ad technology through the acquisition of hosting company Megaphone. However, the company has not disclosed specific performance numbers for its acquired entities. Reports have circulated that Gimlet, one of Spotify's acquisitions, has struggled to grow within the company due to internal tensions and unclear strategy. Furthermore, exclusive podcasts, such as Joe Rogan's show, may have experienced a decline in audience after moving exclusively to the Spotify platform. Despite the closure of Studio 4, Spotify has not yet revealed its plans for the production of partner programs or the fate of ongoing shows. However, the Dissect team confirmed on Twitter that their show would continue to be produced with Spotify. Original programming will also continue within the three existing networks that Spotify acquired. The discontinuation of Studio 4, however, implies that Spotify faced challenges in building an entirely independent production team from scratch. The closure of Studio 4 marks a new chapter for Spotify in its podcasting endeavor. The company's continued focus on podcasting and its acquisitions reflect its ambition to become a major player in the podcast industry. As Spotify moves forward, it remains to be seen how the closure of Studio 4 will impact its overall podcasting strategy and the future direction of its original content production.
