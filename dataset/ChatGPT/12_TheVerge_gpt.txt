In a move that has reignited concerns over the militarization of law enforcement, the New York Police Department (NYPD) has announced the return of its four-legged robot, Digidog, from Boston Dynamics. The robotic dog, which was originally deployed by the NYPD in 2020 for reconnaissance during a standoff with an armed suspect, and again in 2021 for a home invasion, had been shelved amidst concerns about the weaponization of law enforcement and the potential for the robot to infringe on privacy rights. The announcement was made by New York City Mayor Eric Adams during a press event on Tuesday, in which he declared that the robot could "save lives." City officials claim that the NYPD will acquire two robot dogs at a cost of $750,000, and will only deploy them in life-threatening situations, such as bomb threats. The return of Digidog has reignited concerns about privacy and public safety, with critics arguing that the deployment of robotic technology for law enforcement purposes represents a step towards a police state. Privacy advocates have warned that the use of Digidog could infringe on civil liberties, while others have pointed out that the robot's appearance and movements can be intimidating, particularly for marginalized communities. The deployment of Digidog is part of a broader trend towards the use of militarized technologies by law enforcement agencies in America. In recent years, a number of cities across the country have turned to unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and other technologies to assist with policing, surveillance, and crowd control. While advocates argue that such technologies are necessary to keep communities safe, critics warn that they have the potential to infringe on privacy rights and civil liberties. As part of its ongoing efforts to modernize policing techniques, the NYPD is also piloting two other technologies: StarChase's Guardian HX and Knightscope's K5 ASR. The Guardian HX is a device that can be fired from a police vehicle and is intended to attach a GPS tracking tag to fleeing cars, while the K5 ASR is a robot that is designed to collect intelligence and monitor public spaces. The NYPD has stated that the rollout of the technologies will be transparent and conducted in collaboration with the public. The deployment of these technologies has sparked new concerns about the militarization of law enforcement and the potential for the technologies to be misused. Critics have warned that the use of GPS tracking devices could infringe on privacy rights, while others have raised concerns about the possibility of the robot being used for surveillance purposes. The NYPD has defended the use of these technologies, arguing that they are necessary to keep communities safe and to assist with law enforcement efforts. However, civil liberties groups have urged the city to exercise caution and to ensure that the deployment of these technologies is done in accordance with the law and with due consideration for privacy rights. The announcement of the return of Digidog and the rollout of the new technologies comes at a time of heightened concern about police brutality and the use of excessive force by law enforcement. In recent years, the deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and other individuals at the hands of police officers have sparked widespread protests and calls for police reform. Critics argue that the deployment of militarized technologies such as Digidog represents a step away from the principles of community policing and towards a more aggressive, militarized approach to law enforcement. They warn that the use of such technologies can contribute to an us-against-them mentality, and can further erode trust between law enforcement agencies and the communities they serve. The NYPD has stated that it is committed to ensuring that the deployment of new technologies is done in a responsible and transparent manner, and that it will work closely with the public to address concerns and ensure that the technologies are used in accordance with the law. However, civil liberties advocates stress the need for rigorous oversight and for public engagement to ensure that the deployment of these technologies is done in a manner that is consistent with the principles of democratic governance and respect for civil liberties.
