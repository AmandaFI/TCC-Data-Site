Twitter has made a strategic move to compete with the newsletter platform Substack by introducing a new feature called "10,000-character-long tweets" for its Blue subscribers. This new feature will allow users to post up to 10,000 characters in a single tweet, making it easier for them to express their thoughts and ideas in a more comprehensive and detailed way. In addition to the character limit extension, Blue subscribers will also have access to support for bold and italic formatting. This will allow users to enhance the clarity and readability of their tweets, making their posts more visually appealing and engaging. Twitter's introduction of this new feature is part of its effort to attract creators and regain its competitive edge in the social media space. The company recently launched its monetization program, which allows creators to offer subscriptions to users for $2.99, $4.99, and $9.99 per month. This program aims to reward creators for their contributions to Twitter and provide them with a sustainable source of income. However, creators must meet certain requirements to be eligible for monetization. They must be at least 18 years old, have 10,000 active followers, and have tweeted at least 25 times in the last 30 days. These requirements ensure that only committed and active creators can benefit from this program. Twitter's move to introduce 10,000-character-long tweets is timely. It comes after Substack launched its Twitter-like feed called Notes earlier this week. Substack has disrupted the newsletter industry by allowing writers to earn substantial income from their content without the need for mainstream media or publishing companies. With the Notes feature, Substack aims to provide a Twitter-like experience for its users, allowing them to share their thoughts and ideas more quickly and easily. This feature also includes a character limit extension, albeit only up to 10,000 characters. Twitter's response to these developments reflects its determination to remain relevant in the social media space. By introducing longer tweets and monetization options for creators, Twitter hopes to improve user engagement and compete directly with Substack. Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, has been actively involved in the competition between Twitter and Substack. Musk recently introduced creator monetization tools on his social media platform, Twitter rival, "the Dogecoin-funded social media app, lol." However, he has been accused of trying to monopolize the market by blocking links to Substack. Musk has also faced criticism for not delivering on his promise of ad revenue sharing with Twitter Blue subscribers. Despite the challenges, Twitter remains focused on enhancing its platform and creating a more engaging user experience. The company has invested heavily in improving its infrastructure, enhancing its security features, and introducing new tools and features, such as the 10,000-character-long tweets and monetization options for creators. Twitter's 10,000-character-long tweets feature is expected to attract more users and creators to the platform. Longer tweets will allow users to express their views more comprehensively and create more meaningful conversations around important issues. Twitter's monetization program, on the other hand, will provide creators with a sustainable source of income and motivate them to contribute more engaging content to the platform. With these initiatives, Twitter hopes to re-establish itself as a leading social media platform, offering a unique and engaging experience for users and creators alike.
