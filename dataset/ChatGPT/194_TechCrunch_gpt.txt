CoreWeave, a GPU-focused cloud computer provider, has secured $221 million in a series B funding round led by Magnetar Capital, with participation from big names such as Nvidia, former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman, and ex-Apple exec Daniel Gross. The funding will be used to bolster the New York-based firm’s US-based data centre and bring on new employees. CoreWeave is known for its services that allow access to more than a dozen Nvidia GPUs in the cloud for a variety of applications, including machine learning, visual effects, and rendering. The firm’s CEO, Mike Intrator, described the funding round as proof that giants Google Cloud, AWS, and Azure have failed to satisfy demand for generative AI with their “legacy cloud infrastructure.”. The CoreWeave team views generative AI as the key to unlocking the next wave of technological innovation and growth across multiple industries, but traditional cloud providers have thus far lagged behind CoreWeave and other GPU-focused providers who cater to specific verticals. “We serve a lot of customers that come to us with applications that they’ve tried to run on AWS or GCP or Azure, and they just don’t have the generative strength to do it,” Intrator explained. With the new funds, CoreWeave plans to expand its capacity to meet growing demand, as well as make strategic hires. The company has enjoyed significant growth in recent years, reporting a 600% increase in computing power since 2019. The current round brings CoreWeave’s total funding to date to $290 million, with the company's previous investors including Coinbase, Fidelity, and Tiger Global. This latest round highlights the growing interest around the world in the potential of GPU-specific services. CoreWeave's services are designed to offer customers an end-to-end solution to accelerate workflows and speed up the data pipeline. The firm serves a range of industries and sectors, including healthcare, finance, automotive, and gaming, with the overarching mission of supporting sophisticated computational applications that require vast amounts of processing power. CoreWeave is just one of a small group of specialized GPU cloud providers engaged in a fierce battle with the big public cloud platforms. Experts predict that as enterprises seek to unlock the full potential of AI and related technologies, the demand for GPU-focused cloud providers will soar, leading to even more investment in coming years. This raises the question: is CoreWeave destined to become the go-to provider of GPU services for the enterprise, or simply a niche player in a rapidly growing field?. Intrator is bullish on the future of generative AI and the role that CoreWeave and other GPU-focused cloud providers have to play in enabling innovation across numerous industries. He is confident that the kind of computational power offered by CoreWeave is becoming increasingly essential and cannot simply be retrofitted onto existing cloud infrastructure without significant investment. “The incumbents are not well-equipped to deal with this,” Intrator noted. “It's a new type of computing that demands a new type of infrastructure.”. This latest funding round signals a bright future for CoreWeave and the growing market it serves. As demand for generative AI and other GPU-intensive applications continues to surge, specialized GPU providers like CoreWeave are in a prime position to meet the growing needs of the enterprise and accelerate their digital transformation.
