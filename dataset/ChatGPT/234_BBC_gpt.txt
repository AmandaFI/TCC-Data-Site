Title: Half-term travel: UK families cancel Spain trips over vaccination rules; alternative destinations gain popularity. Introduction: Many UK families have been forced to cancel their planned half-term trips to mainland Spain and the Canary Islands due to the requirement for children over 12 to be double vaccinated to enter the country. This has resulted in significant losses for hoteliers in the region, with millions of pounds' worth of trade being affected. In response, hoteliers are urging the Spanish government to ease its restrictions and allow more British travelers. Meanwhile, travel operators have identified alternative destinations such as Mexico and Turkey, which are experiencing increased popularity. Body: 1. Disruption in travel plans due to vaccination requirements: The introduction of the vaccination requirement for children over 12 to enter Spain has led many UK families to cancel or postpone their half-term travel plans. Concerns over the safety, efficacy, and availability of vaccines for children have contributed to this decision. As a result, travel agents are grappling with constantly changing international travel restrictions caused by the Omicron variant. 2. Economic impact on tourism in the Canary Islands: Hoteliers in the Canary Islands are reporting significant losses during what is typically a crucial time of year for tourism. The president of the Tenerife Hoteliers Association estimated the loss to be nearly 400 million euros due to a high number of cancellations. Many businesses in the region are urging the Spanish government to relax its restrictions to attract more British tourists, who are a major source of revenue. 3. Alternative destinations gain popularity: As families search for alternative holiday destinations, TUI, Europe's largest tour operator, has identified Mexico and Turkey as popular alternatives. These countries have not imposed stringent vaccination requirements, making them more appealing to UK travelers. TUI reports comparable booking levels for the upcoming half-term and Easter holidays to those seen in 2019. Other popular destinations include the Dominican Republic, Cape Verde, and the Canaries. 4. Varying entry requirements across countries: While Spain's entry requirements for UK visitors have been particularly strict, other popular holiday destinations such as France also have vaccination requirements for certain activities like skiing. On the other hand, Portugal and Greece have recently eased their entry rules, making them more attractive options for travel. Travel association Abta is working towards greater consistency in travel rules and is urging the UK government to lead international efforts in aligning rules. 5. Increasing reliance on travel agents: With concerns and complications caused by ever-changing restrictions, customers are increasingly turning to travel agents for guidance and assistance in navigating the travel landscape. The advice and expertise of travel agents have become invaluable in ensuring a smooth and stress-free travel experience amidst the uncertainties of the pandemic. 6. Rising holiday bookings: Despite the complications and challenges, holiday bookings are rising rapidly, with one of the UK's largest tour firms reporting levels comparable to those seen before the pandemic. This trend suggests that, despite restrictions, people are eagerly seeking travel opportunities and are determined to enjoy a much-needed break. Conclusion: The requirement for children over 12 to be double vaccinated in order to enter Spain has resulted in the cancellation and postponement of many UK families' half-term travel plans. Hoteliers in the Canary Islands are reporting significant losses, urging the Spanish government to relax its restrictions. In response, travel operators have identified alternative destinations such as Mexico and Turkey, which have gained popularity as they have not imposed strict vaccination requirements. Travel agents have become essential in helping customers navigate the ever-changing international travel landscape.
