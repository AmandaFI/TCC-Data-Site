London-based startup m3ter has secured $17.5 million in funding from Kindred Capital, Union Square Ventures, and Insight Partners. The company aims to develop its product and expand its customer base with the new funding. m3ter provides tools for granular pricing, targeting price-conscious customers who seek more flexible subscription models for software-as-a-service (SaaS) products. The founders of m3ter, Griffin Parry and John Griffin, previously created GameSparks, a backend-gaming-as-a-service engine, which was later acquired by Amazon Web Services (AWS). Parry revealed that the team encountered similar challenges with usage-based pricing that AWS faced, leading them to develop their own custom tools. While m3ter primarily serves fast-scaling SaaS businesses offering usage-based pricing tiers, Parry believes there are opportunities to expand into other sectors like telecommunications and utilities, which are currently upgrading their billing systems. Furthermore, consumers may also be interested in a more affordable and equitable consumption-based pricing model for services such as streaming, broadband, and cloud storage. Interestingly, Metronome, another usage-based pricing company, unveiled its own round of funding just last week. Parry welcomes the competition and believes there is ample room for multiple players in the market. Investors are optimistic about m3ter's potential to become a leader in the SaaS pricing market and revolutionize pricing strategies for SaaS companies worldwide. The funding will play a crucial role in m3ter's plans to enhance its product offerings and accommodate the evolving demands of price-conscious customers. The company's tools for granular pricing empower businesses to customize pricing structures based on usage, enabling customers to pay only for what they need. The rise of SaaS products has spurred the need for more flexible pricing models, with customers increasingly expressing their preference for usage-based pricing over traditional fixed-rate subscriptions. This shift has prompted companies like m3ter to develop innovative solutions to cater to these evolving consumer preferences. Parry envisions m3ter's usage-based pricing technology extending beyond the SaaS industry. As telecommunications and utility companies modernize their billing systems, there is an opportunity for m3ter to provide its tools to these sectors as well. With the growing popularity of streaming services, broadband, and cloud storage, consumers may also benefit from a fairer and more affordable consumption-based pricing approach. Aside from m3ter, other players in the market are recognizing the potential of usage-based pricing. Recently, Metronome secured funding for its own usage-based pricing platform, highlighting the emerging demand for such solutions. Parry views this as positive competition, as it validates the market opportunity and showcases the room for multiple players to thrive. Investors, on the other hand, are highly optimistic about m3ter's future. They believe the company has the potential to become a leading player in the SaaS pricing market and revolutionize pricing strategies on a global scale. With its experienced founders and custom tools, m3ter is well-positioned to disrupt traditional pricing models and meet the growing demand for more flexibility in consumption-based pricing. Through its innovative offerings, m3ter aims to empower businesses to design pricing tiers that suit their specific needs, enabling them to attract a broader customer base and drive growth. As the market continues to evolve, companies are recognizing the need for custom pricing structures that are fair and transparent. m3ter's usage-based pricing technology provides a solution to this evolving demand and presents an opportunity for businesses to differentiate themselves in a competitive landscape. With the new funding, m3ter will accelerate its product development efforts and expand its customer base further. By continuously enhancing its suite of tools for granular pricing, the company aims to solidify its position as a leader in the SaaS pricing market and redefine pricing models for software companies globally.
