Aurora Innovation, the autonomous vehicle company focused on self-driving trucks, is confident it can go ahead with commercialization by 2024, despite the bumpy road ahead. The firm has been hit by challenges that include economic uncertainty, wary investors, tight capital markets, and consolidation. But despite these factors, Aurora has managed to achieve a string of milestones in the last year that include the introduction of pilot programs with a range of big names, such as FedEx, Ryder, Schneider, and Uber Freight, as well as announcing a "feature complete" self-driving system. The plan is for Aurora's self-driving trucks to help the US supply chain address its severe shortage of truck drivers, as well as the high turnover rate, and to provide fleet operators with a boost in revenue per truck. Aurora has encountered regulatory hurdles, with the Californian authorities reluctant to give commercial approval for the firm's autonomous trucks until they are able to safely reach a Level 4 capability. This would mean that humans would no longer need to be present in the vehicle and that it could operate through a range of different traffic conditions. Aurora has also seen cash levels lowered due to financial austerity measures in its drive to commercialize its pioneering technology. Aurora has filed an initial $350m shelf offering of shares, but while the possibilities of fundraising are enormous, the firm is determined to focus on converting all its pilot schemes into long-term customers. Aurora remains confident that it will be able to bring a level of automation to the trucking industry, that's not been seen before, with self-driving trucks capable of operating autonomously over long distances and with optimum efficiency. Aurora believes that its technology is crucial to address the current bottleneck in US supply chains, with truck drivers in such short supply, and an inability to transport goods both efficiently and economically. “Right now, we’re just trying to prove that we can make self-driving trucks work,” said Sterling Anderson, Aurora’s Co-founder and Chief Product Officer, in an interview. “We know beyond just a shadow of a doubt it will help our country and our economy, but we have to prove it, and we have to go through all the costs and uncertainties of getting there.”. Anderson believes that the crucial variable in the equation could be regulation, which could potentially be the key driver for positive change in the sector. Anderson warns that the current state-by-state rules could be an impediment for any self-driving vehicle, and the regulators need to be accepting of a level of experimentation to make this innovation a success. He adds, “Self-driving trucks would be a powerful economic stimulus even without producing returns on invested capital. They’d deliver lower transport costs, fewer human hours, and reduced accidents. Resolving regulatory roadblocks unlocking this technology is both a moral duty and a long-term economic opportunity.”. Aurora's partnership with Ryder is a crucial test of its technology, with the truck rental company enabling the autonomous vehicle maker to test out its pioneering systems, providing the technology to existing vehicles in Ryder's fleet. Aurora's chief financial officer, Friederike Helfer believes that the firm's technology is gaining wider market acceptance. "We need to be focused on customer adoption over the next couple of years," she said. "We have really launched our first live operations in trucking last year and that is really going to be the proving ground for what we're doing.". Despite the challenges and obstacles, Aurora is pressing ahead and continues to refine and improve its technology. The company has now moved its autonomous truck fleet to Texas, where it will continue to undertake testing, including at its forthcoming test facility in San Antonio. The company's efforts to revolutionize US supply chains have not gone unnoticed, with the Biden Administration likely to promote the use of autonomous vehicle technology. There is a realization across the administration that automation will be crucial in driving economic growth in the US. There remains a healthy demand for automation and renewables in supply chain infrastructure that Aurora is hoping to tap into. This includes forms of renewable energy, for example, in micro-grids and non-interconnected areas, through to finding new ways to automate logistic hubs, such as warehousing and distribution centers. Despite the challenging road ahead, Aurora believes that continued innovation and investment is essential for the company to deliver on its ambition to bring autonomous vehicles to the US supply chain sector. It is hoped that through partnerships with firms such as Ryder, Aurora can achieve breakthroughs that will set the firm at the forefront of the industry.
