Microsoft has dealt a blow to Twitter by dropping the social media platform from its advertising plans as Twitter introduces minimum charges of $42,000 per month for enterprise and research institution access to its API. This move by Microsoft seems to be intended as a statement, as the tech giant has the funds to pay the new charges. The decision by Twitter has prompted Elon Musk, the owner of the social media site, to threaten legal action against Microsoft, accusing them of using Twitter data to illegally train their AI models through a licensing agreement with OpenAI â€“ a company that Musk helped found. This action poses a challenge for Musk, who has been courting advertisers since he took over the helm at Twitter in October. "The decision to drop Twitter from our advertising platform was not taken lightly," said a spokesperson for Microsoft. "We have been very pleased with the performance we have seen on Twitter, but with the introduction of these minimum charges, it no longer makes sense for us to pay the associated costs.". The move by Twitter to introduce minimum charges for enterprise and research institution users of its API will undoubtedly impact businesses of all sizes that rely on Twitter for their online marketing. However, it is the potential legal action against Microsoft that has caught the attention of industry experts. Musk's allegation that Microsoft used Twitter data to train its AI models through a licensing agreement with OpenAI could have significant implications for the tech giant. "Elon Musk has made a very serious allegation against Microsoft, and this is something that the company will need to take very seriously," said an industry analyst. "If Microsoft is found to have used Twitter data illegally to train its AI models, it could face significant fines and legal action.". For Musk, the decision by Microsoft to drop Twitter from its advertising platform will undoubtedly be seen as a setback in his efforts to grow the platform's advertising revenue. Since taking over as CEO, Musk has been looking for ways to make Twitter more attractive to advertisers, with a particular focus on small businesses. "Twitter has a huge audience, but it has struggled to monetize that audience in the way that Facebook has," said the analyst. "Musk has been trying to change that by enticing more businesses to advertise on Twitter, but this move by Microsoft will make that task more difficult.". The decision by Twitter to introduce minimum charges for enterprise and research institution users of its API is part of a broader effort by the company to increase its revenue streams. The move has been criticized by some, who argue that it will disproportionately impact smaller businesses that may not have the funds to pay the associated costs. "Twitter has always been a platform that is open to everyone, and this move contradicts that philosophy," said a small business owner. "It feels like Twitter is moving away from its roots, which could drive away some of its core users.". For Twitter, the decision to introduce minimum charges for its API users will undoubtedly impact its business model. However, it may be necessary to increase revenue streams to ensure the long-term sustainability of the platform. "Twitter has faced a lot of challenges in recent years, including falling user numbers and increased competition from other social media platforms," said the analyst. "While the decision to introduce minimum charges for its API users may not be popular with everyone, it may be necessary to ensure the future of the platform.".
