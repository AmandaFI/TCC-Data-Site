India, a global leader in technology and innovation, has revealed that it will not be implementing regulation for artificial intelligence (AI). The Ministry of Electronics and IT stated that the AI industry is "significant and strategic" for the nation and instead, infrastructure measures will be taken to encourage the growth of the industry. Despite concerns surrounding AI such as bias and discrimination, the Indian government sees technology as a key enabler of the digital economy and considers the cultivation of AI as crucial to maintaining their technological edge. India is currently the world’s second-largest internet market and has much more potential for growth in AI industries. Although it is undoubtedly one of the top countries for outsourcing IT services, AI startups have not seen as much success, leading it behind its global competitors in regard to AI growth. Experts believe this decision can lead to the development of a robust AI ecosystem in India, allowing AI startups to flourish and grow. The move could also potentially put India in a significant position globally to become a major player in the development and usage of AI. It is reported that technological innovations in AI could contribute to India's GDP and generate more employment opportunities for the nation. However, with no regulations in place, it does raise the potential issue of possible abuse of power within the tech industry. Some reports suggest that AI becomes more powerful than humans, and it is necessary to have safeguards to ensure that technological evolution is in positive alignment with societal growth. Overall, India’s decision marks a turning point in the global conversation around artificial intelligence (AI) regulation. While the nation sees the significance of AI in their economy, it has still fallen behind other developed countries in terms of growth and innovation. By opting against AI regulations, India hopes to stimulate its AI industry and catch up with its global competitors.
