Accenture, one of the world's leading tech consultancy firms, has announced plans to cut 19,000 jobs, equal to 2.5% of its workforce, as it looks to trim expenses. The job losses will largely be in non-billable corporate functions and will occur over the next 18 months. Accenture had previously increased its workforce by 38,000, but the challenging global economic climate has led to the need to cut jobs. The company said that economic and geopolitical uncertainties and slow client spending are behind the decision to cut jobs. Accenture has revised down its revenue forecast for the year to between 8% and 10%, from 8% and 11%. The company confirmed that it remains committed to investing in areas of high-growth and in-demand digital solutions. Accenture has been at the forefront of supporting companies in the digital transformation process, but the COVID-19 pandemic has left companies struggling to fund this. One of the main areas that will be impacted by job losses is the company's support functions. The remaining employees will continue to work on important projects that involve advanced analytics, cloud technology, and cybersecurity. The company stated that the job cuts are part of a restructuring to ensure that it has the right resources in place to help customers in today's challenging environment. Accenture is not alone in cutting jobs as the pandemic continues to devastate the global economy. Many businesses have been forced to reduce their cost base to remain competitive. The company's announcement of job cuts comes after news that it has partnered with Google to help companies use cloud technology to increase productivity. The partnership will enable Google and Accenture to offer customers a broad range of services, including app development, data migration, and cloud migration. Despite the news of job losses, Accenture is confident about the future and believes that it is well-positioned to support customers with its cutting-edge solutions. It has been a challenging year for many businesses, but Accenture's focus on digital solutions and strategic partnerships should enable it to weather the storm.
