Technology has become the double-edged sword of Asia's protests in recent months as protestors struggle to outsmart ruthless governments that are using 'digital authoritarianism' to counter the power of social media in organizing demonstrations. Anti-government protests have surged in numbers around the world in recent years but they have become less effective as authoritarian regimes find new ways to monitor social media content and shut down dissent. According to analysts, the use of technology as a tool for suppression has reached alarming levels in Asia where governments have been using digital surveillance techniques to control anti-regime sentiments and protests. In China, for instance, the government has been cutting internet access and blocking encrypted messaging apps like WhatsApp in a bid to suppress calls for protests, while in Hong Kong, activists claim that authorities are using facial recognition software and AI-powered monitoring systems to keep a watchful eye on dissidents. The situation has been further exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has forced many activists into quarantine, leaving them isolated and vulnerable. The rise of 'digital authoritarianism'. Digital authoritarianism is a term used to describe regimes that use digital tools to control and suppress dissent. Some governments are using artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, like surveillance cameras and facial recognition software, to monitor citizens and track their movements. Others are using social media platforms, like Twitter and Facebook, to monitor and censor content that is deemed to be critical of the regime. In China, for example, the government has implemented a comprehensive digital surveillance system that relies heavily on AI to monitor citizens and prevent dissent. The system, known as the 'social credit' system, assigns each citizen a score based on their behavior. The score can be used to determine access to public services, like transportation and healthcare, and can even impact job opportunities. In Hong Kong, authorities have been using facial recognition software and AI-powered monitoring systems to track and identify activists who participate in anti-government protests. The use of AI technology has raised concerns over privacy and freedom of expression in the former British colony. Tech companies caught in the crosshairs. Tech companies have also come under scrutiny for their role in enabling authoritarian regimes. Social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and WhatsApp have been used as tools for coordination and communication during protests. However, they have also been used by governments to monitor and censor content. Governments have also been pressuring tech companies to help them in their efforts to suppress dissent. For example, China has been pressuring tech companies to remove content from their platforms that is critical of the regime. In response, some tech companies have taken steps to prevent their products from being used for authoritarian purposes. In 2019, Google announced that it would not be renewing its contract with the US Department of Defense to develop AI technology for use in drone strikes. Is it the end of protests?. Despite the challenges posed by digital authoritarianism, some analysts believe that protests can still be effective. While protests may not achieve their immediate goals, they can lay the groundwork for future demonstrations and inspire political awakening among citizens. The Milk Tea Alliance is a good example of how solidarity among different social movements can be achieved. The Milk Tea Alliance is a loose coalition of pro-democracy protesters across Asia who share similar values and use social media to promote their cause. The movements originated from Thailand, where pro-democracy campaigners began using #MilkTeaAlliance to unite protesters in Hong Kong and Taiwan. The movement has since grown to include a wide range of progressive causes, including feminism, LGBTQ+ rights, and environmentalism. Conclusion. The rise of digital authoritarianism has made it more difficult for anti-government protesters to organize and mobilize people. However, as seen in the case of the Milk Tea Alliance, digital tools can also be used to unite people across the region and promote solidarity among different social movements. Ultimately, it is up to the people on the ground to decide the effectiveness of these efforts. But one thing is clear: in an era of digital authoritarianism, technology has become a double-edged sword for the world's protesters.
