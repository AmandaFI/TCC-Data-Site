Alibaba, the Chinese technology giant, has announced its plan to break up the company, a move that resulted in a surge in its share price. Under the restructuring, five of the six newly created units will explore raising fresh funding and initial public offerings, while Taobao Tmall Commerce Group, the online retail platform, will remain wholly owned by Alibaba. The announcement caused Alibaba's shares to rise over 14% in New York on Tuesday and more than 13% higher in Hong Kong on Wednesday. The company's US-listed shares have fallen almost 70% since 2020 due to concerns over Beijing's crackdown on the tech sector. The restructuring is seen to offer investors value due to the separate business units being able to grow at their own pace and being less likely to encounter antitrust violations. Each unit will have its own CEO and board of directors, and will be allowed to raise capital and seek stock market listings. The move follows years of tough regulatory conditions for Chinese tech firms and the government is expected to shift from being an adversary of companies to supporting them. This is the largest restructuring in the company's 24-year history and follows years of tough regulatory conditions for Chinese tech firms. The government has been known for its tough stance towards these companies, with many facing antitrust investigations and other regulatory issues. However, with the move towards supporting companies, investors have become bullish on the prospects of Chinese tech firms, resulting in rising share prices. The announcement came shortly after reports that Alibaba founder Jack Ma had resurfaced in China after a long absence. Ma, who has been absent from public life since October, reappeared in a video in January, where he spoke to teachers in rural China. His long absence led to speculation about his whereabouts, with some suggesting that he was either detained by the government or had fled the country. Since then, Ma has been seen in public on a number of occasions, including a recent trip to Guangdong province, where he met with staff and toured classrooms. His return has been seen as a sign that he is still involved in the company's operations. The news of the company's restructuring is seen as a further indication that Ma is still actively involved in the company's affairs. The restructuring is likely to be welcomed by investors who have been wary of Chinese tech firms in recent months. The crackdown on these firms has resulted in a number of companies, such as Ant Group and Didi, delaying their initial public offerings. With the government shifting its stance towards being more supportive of these companies, investors are likely to become more bullish in their outlook. Alibaba's shares have been hit hard by the regulatory crackdown, falling almost 70% since 2020. However, the restructuring is seen as a way to unlock value for investors and allow the company's separate units to grow at their own pace. The move is expected to be a turning point for Chinese tech firms, who have faced tough regulatory conditions over the past few years.
