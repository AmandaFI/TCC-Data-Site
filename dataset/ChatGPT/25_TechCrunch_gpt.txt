Autonomous vehicle startup Venti Technologies has secured $28.8m in a Series A funding round to develop its software, collaborate with third parties for hardware and secure further business deals. Venti is focusing on offering autonomous vehicles for supply chain firms that operate across warehouses, ports and shipping and logistics environments. Clients have reported that shifting towards autonomous vehicles could lead to cost savings of 50% or more. Venti has its eye on an industrial market that generates billions in revenue annually. The Series A funding round was led by LG Technology Ventures and included funds from several other investors, including Safar Partners, UOB Venture Management, Alpha JWC and LDV Partners. . Venti Technologies is working on supplying self-driving cargo robots, specialized to complement the existing infrastructure of warehouses and other industrial environments. The robots are designed to replace human-operated forklifts and other manual machines traditionally used for transportation of goods. They automate the process of moving products around large indoor spaces, enabling users to control and manage numerous vehicles simultaneously from a single dashboard. . The company believes that regular guided vehicles like forklifts add significant operational costs in the supply chain, requiring significant manpower, intensive training, and carrying the potential for accidents. Venti's goal is to disrupt the market by providing autonomous solutions to handle transportation and material movement, making it a relatively maintenance-free and more natural process with a quicker return on investment. . The company expects its investment to initially go into improving its software, allowing greater levels of automation and self-learning algorithms. Venti will use the funds to develop partnerships with third-party providers for other hardware and services. The aim is to streamline the entire process and offer customers an end-to-end solution. During the last year, the firm has reached agreements with several clients in Asia and the USA, demonstrating a demand and an appreciation for its product. . Founded in 2019, Venti Technologies, is headquartered in San Francisco, California and has offices in Beijing, China. The Chineses market represents one of the world’s largest logistics industry with companies such as JD.com investing billions in automatic logistics hubs all over the country. The Asia-Pacific logistics market is seeing growth and demand in smart logistics solutions and respective infrastructure development, making it a focal point for Venti's operations in the short term. . The current funding round will allow Venti to establish operations in other global regions as part of the company’s long-term strategy. The startup plans to build its platform locally to address specific regional operational requirements. . The managing director of LG Technology Ventures, Jaiwon Choi remarks: “We believe that Venti Technologies has the potential to revolutionize the industrial logistics market, making it a natural fit for investment.” Choi adds that LG is looking forward to working alongside Venti and their product to provide intelligent solutions for industrial logistics. The CEO of Venti Technologies, Wen Gao, expressed his excitement at the new funding round. He said it would allow them to accelerate their efforts "to create a fully autonomous supply chain that will make logistic hub operations less risky, more flexible, and efficient." He notes that the funds raised mean Venti can expand its reach and provide seamless solutions worldwide. For the future, Venti Technologies hopes to expand by allowing the robots to move outside the industrial warehouse market. The company is dedicating resources to make autonomous machines that can safely operate in public spaces by understanding and complying with the normal flow of pedestrian and vehicle traffic. The roadmap to create more sophisticated machines allows the company to expand its capacity for robotics and serve more significant industries. . The autonomous vehicle market is growing rapidly, with tech companies like Waymo and Tesla investing significant amounts of capital and heavily competing in the autonomous vehicle space of the transportation industry. Still, Venti has a niche audience and purpose in the supply chain and logistics market, which is currently largely unaddressed and presents significant potential for growth. In closing, Venti Technologies is prepared to meet a massive demand for autonomous logistics by improving safety, convenience and offering cost savings for clients with their innovative solution perfectly tailored for warehouse and logistic hubs.
