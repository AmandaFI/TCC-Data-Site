Google has launched an open-source API standard called Ripple, which aims to bring its tiny radar chips, called Soli, to more devices outside of Google. These chips, developed since 2015, have not seen much commercial success, with the ill-fated Pixel phone being their most prominent appearance. However, with Ripple, Google hopes to expand the use of this radar technology to applications such as sleep tracking, controlling smartwatches, and potentially even integrating them into cars. Ford is one of the participants in this new standard, although the specific plans for using the chips have not been revealed. Ripple, technically under the Consumer Technology Association (CTA), is clearly a project led by Google. The Ripple project on Github contains references to Google, and contributors must sign a Google open-source license agreement. While Ripple seems to be a rebranding of Google's previously proposed "Standard Radar API," it presents the intriguing idea of radar technology having privacy benefits. Unlike microphones or cameras, radar can detect presence and actions without compromising privacy. Ford, known for its groundbreaking innovations in automotive technology, is researching how to use interior radar as a sensor source to enhance customer experiences beyond their current driver-assist technologies. By participating in the Ripple initiative, Ford aims to explore the potential benefits of these tiny radar chips. A standard API with semiconductor industry participation would allow software development independent of hardware sourcing, unleashing more innovation possibilities for software teams. Although Ford has not disclosed its specific plans for using the radar chips, it is clear that they will not be replacing the advanced exterior radar currently used for driver-assist capabilities. Instead, the focus is on utilizing the tiny radar chips for interior enhancements and further improving customer experiences. It is worth noting that Google is not the only company exploring the use of radar technology. Amazon, for example, is also investigating its applications, particularly in the field of sleep monitoring. In Google's Ripple initiative, most participants are chip and sensor suppliers. However, Ford and Blumio, which has a development kit for a radar-based blood pressure sensor, are also involved. This collaboration between companies from various industries highlights the potential of radar technology in diverse applications. The launch of Ripple opens up exciting possibilities for the use of radar technology beyond its previous limited scope. With Google's Soli chips now potentially finding applications in sleep tracking, smartwatches, and even cars, the industry is poised for innovation and advancements that could revolutionize these areas. The participation of Ford, a renowned automotive leader, adds credibility to the potential of this technology. While the specifics of Ford's plans for using the tiny radar chips remain undisclosed, it is clear that the company is committed to leveraging emerging technologies to enhance customer experiences. By participating in the Ripple initiative, Ford aims to explore how interior radar can provide additional insights and capabilities, going beyond their current driver-assist technologies. As Ripple gains traction and more companies join the initiative, the possibilities for radar technology continue to expand. Privacy-conscious consumers may find radar technology appealing, as it offers the potential to detect presence and actions without relying on microphones or cameras. With Google's Soli chips and the open-source Ripple API standard, the stage is set for transformative innovations in various industries, from automotive to healthcare and beyond.
