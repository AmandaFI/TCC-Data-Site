Software Investors Must (Re)Learn These 3 Ideas Before Getting Into Deep Tech. The traditional software investing playbook has become common knowledge in the finance industry, leading to low-margin business and an inability to invest in the next big thing: deep tech. However, unless software investors can unlearn their playbook, they will become extinct alongside the companies they are eager to fund. To invest in deep tech, investors need to relearn three things: counting on one or two companies for returns is foolish, the market is king, and founders cannot rely on "figuring it out" along the way. Deep tech takes decades to bear fruit, and companies cannot do a hard pivot. A deep tech company needs to get the market right from day one with a strong product-market fit and go-to-market strategy. If investors count on one company for returns, they're betting everything on one horse. Diversification is key in a portfolio, ensuring that there are multiple avenues for returns. This is especially true for deep tech, where it can take years for a company to develop and bear fruit. The market is king when it comes to deep tech. Investors need to look at the market demand, potential competitors, and how the industry is evolving. It's vital to understand how the product will fit into the market and how it will evolve. Investors who ignore the market will ultimately miss out on the big picture. Founders cannot rely on "figuring it out" along the way. Developing deep tech requires a strong vision, an investment of time and resources, and an experienced team. Investors need to have patience when investing in deep tech. They need to understand that the payoff will be down the line, possibly taking several years. They must also understand that the company will need to be in it for the long haul and will need to continuously develop their product while staying ahead of the competition. Such companies require a strong investment of time, resources, and experience. A strong product-market fit and a go-to-market strategy are key to successful investment in deep tech. Investing in deep tech requires a new way of thinking. Investors need to unlearn their traditional playbook and relearn the importance of diversification, understanding market demand, and the need for strong product-market fit and go-to-market strategy. If investors can do this, they will not only be able to stay relevant in the ever-evolving world of technology but also be able to capitalize on the next big thing in deep tech. Failure to do so could be detrimental to their longevity in this ever-evolving industry.
