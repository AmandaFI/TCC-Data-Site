Bank governor warns firms raising prices ‘hurts people’. Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey has warned businesses that raising their prices to combat inflation may ultimately damage consumers. Inflation recently hit a 10.4% annual rate, pushing companies to offset these costs by increasing their prices. Bailey has expressed concerns that higher rates of inflation may lead to further interest rate hikes, making it more challenging for those struggling with higher prices for essentials like fuel and food. He fears that increasing interest rates could discourage borrowing and spending that may negatively impact homeowners with existing mortgages. Bailey suggested that companies should instead look for ways to offset their costs without raising prices. While businesses must remain viable, Bailey stressed the need to consider the impact business decisions have on the public, as price hikes can disproportionally impact the most vulnerable and disadvantaged in society. In a response, CEO of Rare Restaurants, Martin Williams, noted that companies like his had tried to balance "keeping pricing low" to attract customers while "keeping their businesses viable". Williams said that his organization had already attempted to offset rising costs by extracting savings in operational areas like utilities and systems. Still, businesses are looking for ways to cover increased costs. As raw material prices rise faster than income, the steep increase in costs makes it increasingly challenging for businesses to maintain prices without passing the extra costs onto consumers. In response to Bailey’s comments, other business leaders have also raised concerns. Peter Cowgill, JD Sports CEO, shared that their pricing has yet to move higher, but it's an ongoing concern. He warned that if the current demand surge continues, it would lead to stronger pricing across the board, making it increasingly difficult to balance affordable pricing with operational costs. The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) has also suggested escalating inflation is causing concern for businesses, highlighting that many SMEs are struggling to pay higher wages, rental, and energy costs without passing them on to customers. The current rate of inflation is the highest since September 2011, primarily driven by the ongoing pandemic. The sudden surge in demand for goods and services, coupled with the supply chain's constraints, has led to raw material prices rising. Inflation measures the rate of change in the price of essential goods and services over time. A higher inflation rate means goods and services are becoming increasingly expensive. This rise in prices is usually caused by market demand, a shortage of available products, a lack of product availability, or rising production costs. Prices of raw materials rose by 12.1%, with global supply chains, logistics, packaging, and transport costs driving inflation higher. These costs are passed on to the businesses that purchase raw materials and their manufacturing processes. Due to the pandemic's impact on production facilities, supply chains have been bogged down, and customers are experiencing increased wait times and higher prices. As of August 2021, the UK's inflation rate was 3.2%, up from the 2.0% recorded in the previous thirty days, and the highest rate since March 2012. This rate compares with the Bank of England's inflation target of 2%, which has been in place since 1992. Bailey warned of the dangers of allowing inflation to continue rising. As prices increase, people pay more for goods and services and invest less in other asset classes like stocks, bonds or commodities. Higher inflation rates ultimately lead to increased interest rates, which can lead to higher borrowing costs and a greater burden on those already struggling to make ends meet. Although the rate of inflation currently remains above the Bank of England's target, central banks in many countries around the world have also experienced an increase in inflation due to the pandemic. With time, they may be better able to manage inflation to keep prices stable for everyone. However, it is likely that prices will continue to rise for some time before becoming stable again. The pandemic has led to extensive supply chain disruption, and businesses are still battling to catch up with demand, causing costs to continue to rise. As such, the Bank of England and other central banks around the world are monitoring the situation and looking for ways to curb inflation while supporting global trade and the economy. In conclusion, businesses face a challenging situation as the rate of inflation continues to rise. While it is tempting to increase prices to offset increased costs, it could end up hurting the most vulnerable people in society, making it more difficult for them to afford essential items. Instead, businesses must explore alternative approaches to maintain viability without impacting those who may already be struggling to make ends meet. On the other hand, the Bank of England and other central banks must balance the need for market stability with supporting economic recovery and growth.
