This update just made your Roomba i3 smarter. iRobot has recently rolled out a firmware update for its popular Roomba i3 robot vacuum, introducing new features that were previously only available in more expensive models. The update aims to enhance the user experience and make the iRobot Genius software smarter at no additional cost. One of the key additions is the smart maps feature, which allows users to specify exactly which rooms the Roomba i3 should clean, rather than having it clean the entire house. This feature utilizes advanced technology that enables the vacuum to learn the floor plan of the home without the need for a camera. This is a significant improvement as it provides more control and flexibility in directing the robot's cleaning efforts. However, it's important to note that the update does not include the ability to create Keep Out Zones and Clean Zones. These features, which allow users to designate areas where the robot should avoid or focus on cleaning, still require the usage of separate Virtual Wall Barriers. While it would have been ideal to have these functionalities integrated into the update, the smart maps feature is still a welcome addition for Roomba i3 users. Furthermore, the firmware update also brings app-enabled Keep Out and Clean zones to the Roomba j7 Plus model. This advanced feature utilizes intelligent navigation to recognize and avoid potential obstacles or delicate household items, ensuring a smooth and efficient cleaning experience. The Roomba j7 Plus, with its intelligent navigation capabilities, offers an elevated level of convenience and peace of mind. For those seeking powerful suction capabilities, the Roomba s9 Plus remains the top choice. Although it does not have intelligent navigation like the Roomba j7 Plus, it is equipped with the most powerful suction in the Roomba line-up. All three models - Roomba i3, Roomba j7 Plus, and Roomba s9 Plus - are also compatible with iRobot's Braava Jet M6 robot mop, providing a comprehensive cleaning solution for both vacuuming and mopping needs. The Roomba i3, priced at $349.99, is the most affordable model that can be paired with the Clean Base Automatic Dirt Disposal technology. This feature enables the vacuum to automatically empty its bin into the Clean Base, reducing the need for frequent manual emptying. For users seeking this added convenience, the i3 Plus model, which includes the Clean Base, is available at $549.99. It's worth mentioning that the Roomba i3 model is also being sold under the names i4 and i4 Plus at various retail stores. This allows customers to easily identify the equivalent models when shopping for the product. With this firmware update, iRobot continues to demonstrate its commitment to improving its products and providing valuable features to its customers. The introduction of smart maps to the Roomba i3 opens up a world of possibilities for a more tailored and efficient cleaning experience. As technology advances, iRobot is dedicated to equipping its products with the latest innovations, ensuring that users can benefit from intelligent and user-friendly cleaning solutions.
