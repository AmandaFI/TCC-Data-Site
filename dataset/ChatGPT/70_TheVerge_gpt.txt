Hulu announced today that it will be rolling out a major redesign of its TV app over the next few weeks, in an effort to improve the user experience and make it more intuitive. The update will change the interface and navigation of the app, making it easier for users to find what they're looking for and access their favorite content. Previously, the search, Home, TV, Movies, News, My Stuff, and Hubs buttons were located across the top of the screen, which some users found unintuitive and difficult to navigate. The new design will move these buttons to a sidebar on the left side of the screen, making them more accessible and easier to find. The redesigned interface also includes a new "browse" menu, which will display a selection of popular TV shows and movies, as well as personalized recommendations based on the user's viewing history. This feature is intended to help users discover new content that they might not have otherwise found. In addition to these changes, the overall look and feel of the Hulu app has been updated to be more modern and visually appealing. The menu icons have been updated with a new color scheme, and the sidebar now features larger text, making it easier to read. The new design brings Hulu's TV app more in line with its competitors, such as HBO Max, Netflix, YouTube, and Disney Plus, all of whom use a sidebar design. This move is part of a larger trend in the streaming industry towards a more unified design language, making it easier for users to switch between different services without having to re-learn each app's specific navigation. While some users may resist the change at first, Hulu says that the new interface will ultimately make the app easier to use and more enjoyable for everyone. In testing, users reported that they found the new design significantly more intuitive than the previous one, and were able to find the content they were looking for more quickly and easily. The redesigned Hulu app will be rolled out gradually over the next few weeks, starting with smart TV interfaces and streaming boxes. Users should keep an eye out for an update notification on their device, and follow the prompts to download the new version of the app. Overall, this is a positive move for Hulu, and one that its users should welcome. By simplifying its interface and making it more intuitive, Hulu is likely to see an increase in user engagement and satisfaction, which could translate into higher subscriber numbers in the long run.
