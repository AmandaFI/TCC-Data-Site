Esports fans, get ready! Riot Games has transformed their esports arena for the launch of their new Valorant league called VCT Americas, which will cover North America, Latin America, and Brazil. This is the first time that Valorant games will take place live and in-person in North America. The redesigned studio is set up to host games of both League of Legends and Valorant, making the space very high tech and flexible to accommodate the needs of both esports games. The new space is modular, which means it can support the needs of each game and make them look distinct from each other. This is an important feature of the new studio as Riot Games will be able to make changes and new adaptations more quickly and efficiently in the future. Dawn Persson, who led the tech and production side of the redesign, said that it currently takes around two hours and 12–16 people to transform the space from League to Valorant and vice versa. However, the modular nature of the new space should allow the production teams to adapt more quickly in the future. The revamped studio will be a permanent home for both esports leagues and the Valorant league is brand new. Fans of both League of Legends and Valorant will be able to see the new space when the VCT Americas kicks off on April 1st. The esports arena in Los Angeles was designed to be an immersive, fan-centric environment, which was created to give viewers the best possible esports experience. Riot Games understands the importance of having an engaged and supportive fan base. They believe that esports fans are the backbone of the industry and that it is important for them to feel included and invested in the overall experience. For esports fans who have not yet experienced the feeling of being in an esports stadium, the new Riot Games arena is like nothing else. The arena seats around 1700 people and is fully equipped with a state-of-the-art sound and lighting system. The new space also includes custom-designed LED panels, which are fully synchronized to deliver immersive visuals. The panels can change to match the theme of the game being played, and they can even be set up to simulate the look and feel of the game. In addition to the new technology, fans are also excited about the new seating arrangements. The studio's seating is designed to accommodate both casual and competitive esports fans and allows all viewers to feel included. The arena has seating options for both upper and lower levels, with the lower level providing a more intimate and immersive experience, while the upper level offers a more expansive view of the action. The new studio is poised to take the esports experience to a new level. Riot Games hopes that the new VCT Americas league will be a hit among players and fans alike. The studio’s designers have worked tirelessly to ensure that the space will be able to accommodate its needs, from the game layouts to the viewing experience. With the new modular design, the studio will be able to adapt and evolve along with the esports industry. Riot Games has also made a significant investment in the talent behind the production of the new studio. The company has brought together top professionals from across the esports industry to work on this project. The team includes producers, directors, and engineers who have years of experience in staging live events. The team is also committed to pushing the boundaries of what is possible in the esports industry, which they believe will result in exciting and engaging gameplay experiences for fans. The new Riot Games studio is much more than just a revamp of an existing space. The designers of the VCT Americas League have worked to create a truly immersive and cohesive experience that aims to bring the best of the esports industry to fans around the world. Their work has not gone unnoticed, and this new league is poised to be a major player in the esports industry. The VCT Americas league is set to launch on April 1st, and Riot Games expects to have a great turnout for the event. With the combined experience of the designers and production team, and the enthusiastic support of the esports community, the future of the Valorant league and the Riot Games studio is looking very bright indeed.
