MIT is reinstating SAT and ACT requirements for incoming students. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) has announced that it will reinstate the requirement for students to provide SAT or ACT scores for future admissions. This requirement was initially waived at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic to alleviate stress and obstacles faced by students graduating from US high schools in 2020, 2021, and 2022. The decision to reinstate the standardized test requirement was made based on several factors. The College Board, which administers the SAT, reported that millions of students were unable to take the test as scheduled in 2020 due to COVID-19 restrictions. The ACT admissions test also faced disruptions. However, MIT has now stated that standardized test scores help them assess the academic preparedness of applicants and identify socioeconomically disadvantaged students who may lack access to advanced coursework. MIT believes that a standardized test requirement is more equitable and transparent than a test-optional policy, as it provides a standardized metric to evaluate all applicants. The university will still consider students who are unable to safely take a standardized test, ensuring that no student is disadvantaged due to extraordinary circumstances. While MIT has made this decision, it remains uncertain how many other schools will follow suit and reinstate the standardized test requirements. According to the nonprofit organization FairTest, over 1,800 schools had made test scores optional for admissions in the high school class of 2022. Each institution will need to consider the unique circumstances they faced during the pandemic and the impact on their applicant pool. In addition to MIT's decision, the College Board is also making changes to the SAT. Starting in 2024 in the US, and 2023 for other countries, the SAT will transition to an all-digital format. The organization plans to reduce the test duration to two hours and allow more time per question. The reading passages will also cover a wider range of topics. Furthermore, calculators will be permitted in the math section, and test results will be available more quickly to students. MIT's reinstatement of the standardized test requirements has sparked conversations about the role of these tests in college admissions and whether they truly measure an applicant's potential for success. Some argue that standardized tests can be biased and disadvantage certain groups of students, while others believe they provide a fair and objective way to assess academic abilities. This debate will continue as universities navigate the new normal in admissions processes. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact education, institutions must adapt to the challenges faced by students and find ways to evaluate their potential fairly. MIT's decision to reinstate the SAT and ACT requirements is a step towards returning to pre-pandemic admission practices, but it also raises questions about equity and access in higher education.
