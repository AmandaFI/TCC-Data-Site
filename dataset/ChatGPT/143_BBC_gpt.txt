Residents of Jersey could soon experience faster internet services with the rollout of 5G, following a request by the Jersey Competition Regulatory Authority (JCRA) to Ofcom, seeking permission for local providers JT and Sure to upgrade their networks. 5G networks provide better and faster internet speeds than previous generations of technologies, and the JCRA CEO, Tim Ringsdore, has stated that the upgrade to 5G is a priority for the authority. Ringsdore confirmed that the JCRA had engaged with the government, industry leaders, and other key stakeholders to ensure their approach was in line with Ofcom's expectations. Approval from Ofcom would allow telecommunications providers to launch 5G services on the island. The launch of this network in Jersey would be a significant step forward for businesses and individuals on the island, offering a more efficient and speedier service. With an ever-increasing number of devices requiring internet connectivity, 5G would provide a better infrastructure for businesses on the island to operate seamlessly. Additionally, islanders would benefit from improved access to information, entertainment, and communication services, and potentially a considerable boost to the economy.
