Apple is reportedly developing an AI-powered health coaching service that aims to help people exercise more, eat better and sleep more soundly. The service, called Quartz, will use data from users' Apple Watches to create personalised coaching programmes. According to sources, the service will have a monthly fee and is planned for release next year, although it could be postponed or cancelled. Apple is also developing technology to track emotions and is expected to launch an iPad version of its Health app later this year. The Quartz service will use data collected by the Apple Watch's sensors to recommend exercises and workouts based on the user's preferences and fitness levels. It will also provide tips on healthy eating, recommending meals based on the user's dietary preferences and any allergies or intolerances. The service will utilise data on the user's sleep patterns to suggest ways to improve their sleep quality, such as adjusting the temperature and lighting in their bedroom. Quartz will also monitor the user's heart rate to ensure that they are not over-exerting themselves during workouts. Apple is also said to be working on blood pressure and glucose monitoring using non-invasive sensors and finger pricks respectively. The development of the Quartz service is part of Apple's ongoing efforts to position the Apple Watch as a tool not just for fitness, but also for overall health and wellness. One of the biggest challenges in the development of the Quartz service has been ensuring that the user's data is kept private and secure. Apple has stated that it will not share user data with third parties without the user's consent. Apple's focus on health and wellness is not just limited to its services and products. The company has also launched a number of initiatives to promote healthy living, including its "Healthy Hour" programme, which encourages employees to take time off work to engage in physical activity. The development of the Quartz service comes at a time when interest in health and wellness is at an all-time high. With the COVID-19 pandemic highlighting the importance of maintaining good health, many people are turning to technology to help them stay healthy and fit. Given the success of Apple's existing health and fitness offerings, such as the Health app and the Apple Watch, there is every reason to expect that the Quartz service will be a hit with consumers. However, as with any new product or service, it remains to be seen whether the Quartz service will live up to the hype. Apple is renowned for its attention to detail and commitment to user experience, so it is likely that the service will be of high quality and will meet the needs of its target audience. As the development of the Quartz service continues, it will be interesting to see how the service evolves and how Apple positions it within its overall health and wellness ecosystem. Whether it succeeds or fails, one thing is clear: Apple's focus on health and wellness is only going to grow stronger in the years to come.
