Glossier, the popular beauty brand, has recently made the difficult decision to lay off around one-third of its corporate employees, resulting in the termination of 80 jobs. The majority of these cuts will affect the company's technology team, as Glossier shifts its strategy to enlist the help of external partners for certain aspects of its platform that were previously maintained internally. This move comes as Glossier acknowledges its recent mistakes, including a spotlight on its prioritization of strategic projects that distracted from its core beauty business, as well as its overly aggressive hiring practices. In an internal email, Glossier CEO Emily Weiss opened up about these missteps and expressed regret over the negative impact they had on the company. The layoffs within the tech team are especially significant for Glossier, whose image has been closely associated with being a technology-driven beauty retailer. To create a seamless customer experience, the company had developed its own point-of-sale system and commerce APIs in-house. However, this decision to outsource certain technology-related responsibilities to external partners indicates a shift in Glossier's approach. Glossier, which was founded in 2014, gained early success as a direct-to-consumer (DTC) brand. Despite securing impressive fundraising achievements and seeing e-commerce sales account for 80% of its revenue, the company has faced several challenges in recent times. Among these were laying off its entire retail staff and closing all physical locations in August 2020 due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Glossier has also faced criticism for instances of racism experienced by some employees of color, prompting a public apology from CEO Emily Weiss. Despite these setbacks, Glossier had announced plans last year to open permanent physical stores in Seattle, Los Angeles, London, and to reopen its flagship store in New York City. The company's website currently suggests further retail store openings in the future, showcasing its resilience and determination to maintain a strong presence both online and offline. While the recent layoffs have undoubtedly been a difficult decision for Glossier, the company remains committed to delivering high-quality beauty products and experiences to its customers. The shift in its technology strategy reflects a desire to optimize operations and focus on its core strengths. Glossier will continue to evolve and adapt to the ever-changing landscape of the beauty industry, ensuring that it remains a leading brand in the market. As Glossier moves forward, it will be interesting to see how these changes impact the company's growth and future endeavours. With a redefined focus and renewed determination, the brand will strive to regain momentum and solidify its position as a key player in the beauty and technology sectors.
