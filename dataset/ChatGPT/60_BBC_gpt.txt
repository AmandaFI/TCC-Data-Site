Smart glasses are revolutionizing heart procedures at Basildon Hospital in the UK. The hospital is using the technology to speed up processes and reduce the waiting list for transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) procedures. TAVI is a minimally invasive surgery which replaces the patient's diseased aortic valve with an artificial one. The procedure is usually performed on elderly patients who are unable to withstand open-heart surgery. The smart glasses are worn by the hospital staff and allow remote experts to guide them through the procedure. The glasses share live video and audio, allowing for real-time communication between the staff and the experts. This remote assistance helps to speed up the procedure and reduce the risk of complications. Boston Scientific, a biomedical engineering firm, provides support for the smart glasses technology. The glasses have been a game-changer for Basildon Hospital, reducing the waiting time for TAVI procedures from over seven months to just two-and-a-half months. Markus Krämer, Basildon Hospital's clinical director for cardiology, said, "The smart glasses allow our team to perform the heart procedures effectively and efficiently, and we can get patients onto the treatment pathway much quicker. This is essential because every day that a patient is on the waiting list can put them at risk.". In addition to reducing waiting times, the smart glasses also allow for remote training of staff, ensuring that they are using the latest techniques and technologies. This will help to improve patient outcomes and reduce the risk of complications. The smart glasses technology can also be used in other procedures in the future, providing additional support to hospital staff. The glasses could be used for a wide range of surgical procedures, including orthopedic surgeries and neurosurgeries. Krämer said, "The potential applications for this technology are endless. We are delighted with the results we have seen so far, and we look forward to exploring how we can use this technology for other procedures in the future.". The smart glasses are just one example of how technology is revolutionizing the healthcare industry. From telemedicine to artificial intelligence, healthcare providers are embracing new technologies to improve patient outcomes and reduce costs. As the technology continues to evolve, it is likely that we will see even more innovative solutions being developed, providing additional support to healthcare providers and improving patient care. The smart glasses technology is just the beginning of what promises to be an exciting future for healthcare.
