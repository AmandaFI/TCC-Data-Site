BREAKING NEWS: Digital media company Starboard has acquired Parler and will be temporarily shutting down the controversial social network to launch a revamped version. Parler gained notoriety in early 2021, after Twitter and Facebook banned former President Donald Trump from their platforms for violating community guidelines. Trump supporters flocked to Parler, which had looser moderation policies, making it a hub for far-right conspiracy theories and extremist content. Now, with its acquisition by Starboard, Parler is set to undergo substantial changes. In a statement, Starboard announced that it plans to “rebuild” the platform with a focus on “strong content moderation” and building a community of individuals who value “free speech and open dialogue.”. This decision comes after Parler was banned from Google Play, Amazon, and Apple for its perceived role in facilitating the planning of the January 6 Capitol insurrection. In January, Apple reinstated Parler on its app store after the company made some changes to its moderation practices. Amazon Web Services (AWS) also lifted its ban on Parler in February, but the social media platform remains off Google Play Store since its ban in January. According to Starboard, Parler’s new management team will focus on “core technology and product development” as well as “expanding the platform’s audience and user engagement” when it relaunches. Meanwhile, users of Parler will not be able to access the platform for an unspecified period while the site is undergoing reconstruction. However, Starboard notes that users will receive regular updates on the progress of the overhaul via email and social media. The move by Starboard to acquire Parler, along with its previous acquisition of Olympic Media, highlights the company’s aim to expand its reach in the digital media landscape. These acquisitions give Starboard a foothold in the social media world, allowing it to potentially compete with the likes of Facebook and Twitter in the future. The acquisition and overhaul of Parler may also ease concerns among the broader public and regulators about its previous role as a haven for extremism and hate speech. Speaking on the acquisition, Starboard CEO John Larkin praised Parler’s potential for being “a powerful platform for free speech” but noted that significant changes were required to address “the legitimate concerns raised by policy makers and the public alike.”. Despite Larkin’s comments, Parler’s history of hosting extremist content may prove a hurdle for its relaunch. Parler reportedly offered some users a platform to incite violence in the lead-up to the Capitol riot. Starboard acknowledges the challenge of moderating content on a social network with such a diverse user base. The acquisition of Parler by Starboard comes at a time of heightened scrutiny over online extremist content and calls by regulators and lawmakers to hold tech companies accountable for their role in disseminating it. A revamped and more responsibly moderated Parler could help ease these concerns, but only time will tell whether the controversial social network can make a comeback in a digital landscape dominated by established players such as Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram.
