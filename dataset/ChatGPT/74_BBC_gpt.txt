Central banks around the world have taken swift and coordinated action to prevent a major credit crunch, following the failures of two US banks and the rescue of Credit Suisse. The Bank of England, alongside other global counterparts, has taken measures to boost the flow of US dollars in an effort to ease strains in global funding markets. The move comes amid growing fears of a broader credit crunch, as investors flee risky assets and hoard cash amidst the economic turmoil caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. With the pandemic continuing to ravage economies around the world, central banks are seeking to prevent risks from spilling over and to lessen the impact on the supply of credit to households and businesses. The measures are the first of their kind since the 2008 financial crisis and represent a significant backstop for the global financial system. The Bank of England's Governor, Andrew Bailey, stated that the central bank is "ready to take further action if necessary to ensure the continued stability of the banking system and financial markets.". Under the new arrangements, British banks will be able to go directly to the Bank of England for US dollar funding, instead of borrowing on the open market. The Bank of England will then borrow from the US Federal Reserve in order to boost the supply of dollars available to British banks. The US dollar cash flow arrangement will last until the end of April. The Bank of England's move comes after the failures of two US banks last week, Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, which raised fears of a broader run on other banks. The rescue of Credit Suisse, which was forced to suspend trading in a $10bn supply chain finance fund linked to Greensill Capital last week, also highlighted the risks facing the financial system. The global coordination by central banks is aimed at preventing a repeat of the 2008 crisis, when the collapse of Lehman Brothers sparked a major credit crunch and threatened the stability of the entire global financial system. Central banks have been keen to avoid a repeat of this scenario, and have taken swift action to prevent any contagion from spreading. The measures taken by central banks are likely to have a significant impact on the wider economy, with the availability of credit a crucial factor in supporting economic growth and investment. Despite the ongoing difficulties posed by the pandemic, a stable financial system is seen as crucial to supporting a sustained recovery. The Bank of England's announcement was warmly welcomed by bankers and investors, who greeted the move as a sign of confidence in the global financial system. The head of one major investment bank stated that the measures represented a "crucial backstop" and would help to prevent a major credit crunch. The Bank of England has been closely monitoring the impact of the pandemic on the financial system, and has been working closely with other central banks to take coordinated action. The Bank has also been working to support the economic recovery, with measures such as low interest rates and asset purchase programmes designed to boost lending and investment. Despite the current challenges facing the economy, the Bank of England remains optimistic about the longer-term prospects for growth. Speaking earlier this week, Governor Bailey stated that he is confident that the UK economy will bounce back strongly as the pandemic is brought under control, and that the Bank will continue to take action to support this recovery. The actions taken by central banks are likely to continue to evolve over the coming weeks and months, as the pandemic continues to pose significant challenges for the global economy. However, the swift and coordinated response to the current crisis has been widely praised by investors and bankers, with many seeing it as a sign of the resilience of the global financial system.
