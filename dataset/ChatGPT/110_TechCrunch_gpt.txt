AI startup Runway has launched its first mobile app, granting users easy access to its video-to-video generative AI model, Gen-1. Runway is already known for developing Stable Diffusion, an AI image generator that has garnered attention from artists and enthusiasts alike. The app, exclusive to iOS users, allows users to quickly convert any existing video into an AI video. By uploading an image or generating an idea using a text prompt, image or style preset, users can transform their videos into unique and exciting works of art. The app offers a variety of styles, from claymation to charcoal sketches, watercolor art, and paper origami. While the free version of the app comes with limitations, including a restriction on five-second videos and 14 credits for every second of use, Runway has plans to add support for longer videos and improve the app's efficiency in the coming weeks and months. Notably, the app does not generate nudity or copyright-protected work. For those interested in accessing more than just the app's video-to-video generative AI model, Runway offers two premium subscriptions. The Standard plan costs $143.99 per year, while the Pro plan costs $344.99 per year. Both plans offer access to over 30 other AI tools, including Stable Diffusion, asset optimization, and video synthesis. According to Runway, the app is geared towards creatives who want to explore different styles and generate unique pieces of art. With the app, artists can create animations, music videos or add AI-generated effects to their traditional work, giving them a new way to explore their creativity. Runway's founder, Crist√≥bal Valenzuela, is no stranger to the world of AI. In 2019, he gave a TED Talk on the intersection of creativity and AI, discussing how the technology can be used to enhance artistic skills rather than replace them. The launch of the app is reflective of this mindset, providing a tool for artists to explore and experiment with the power of AI alongside their traditional techniques and ideas. The app has been met with excitement from users online, with many eager to explore the various styles and possibilities that Runway's generative AI offers. One user claimed the app was "a game-changer" while another praised its user-friendly interface and easy-to-understand tutorials. However, the app is not without its limitations. Currently, it is only available on iOS devices, which restricts potential users who may not have Apple devices. Additionally, the pricing for the premium subscriptions may be a barrier for some, with many expressing a desire for more affordable options. Despite these limitations, Runway's debut mobile app is a promising development in the world of AI and creativity. With its easy-to-use interface and wide variety of styles, it opens up a new avenue for artists and creatives to incorporate AI-generated effects and techniques into their work. As Runway continues to improve the app's functionality and add new features, it will be exciting to see what artists create using this generative AI tool.
