Peacock subscribers can now enjoy streaming their favorite shows and live events on Meta Quest virtual reality (VR) devices, as part of a three-year partnership between NBCUniversal and Meta. The deal will see the streaming app available on Meta Quest 2 and Meta Quest Pro devices, potentially boosting revenue for both companies. With Peacock offering up to 90,000 hours of content, users can now watch their favorite movies, TV shows and live sporting events on their VR headsets. The platform includes Major League Baseball and NFL games, giving sports fans the opportunity to feel like they're right at the heart of the action. What's more, users can multitask while watching Peacock content on their Meta Quest devices, by browsing the internet or other apps within the VR platform. This innovative feature makes it easy for viewers to keep up with their favorite content while simultaneously staying connected with the wider world. Later this year, Meta plans to expand the partnership by bringing NBCU IP to Meta Horizon Worlds and the Meta Avatars Store. This move is expected to encourage even more users to sign up for Peacock and invest in Meta's virtual reality offerings. The partnership comes at a critical time for Meta, which has witnessed a decline in its quarterly revenue. By collaborating with NBCUniversal, the company hopes to generate more revenue and position itself as a leader in the emerging VR market. In a statement regarding the partnership, Scott Reich, Vice President of Platform and Product Management at Peacock said, "We're thrilled to partner with Meta to bring Peacock to VR and offer our subscribers an immersive streaming experience like no other. With Meta Quest devices, viewers can now explore Peacock's vast library of movies, TV shows and live events in a truly unique way.". Reich added, "Our ambition has always been to deliver the best streaming experience to our customers, and the partnership with Meta is a key component of that mission.". Likewise, Meta CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, expressed his enthusiasm for the partnership. He said, "We're excited to welcome Peacock to the Meta platform and provide our users with even more entertainment options. By bringing NBCU's extensive content library to Meta Quest devices, we're broadening our appeal and striving to provide the most immersive VR experience possible.". The collaboration between NBCUniversal and Meta highlights the growing importance of virtual reality devices as a means of accessing content. With more consumers investing in VR headsets, the partnership provides an opportunity for Peacock to capture this growing audience and expand its subscriber base. Moreover, the combination of VR technology with Peacock's vast library of content could prove a powerful draw for sports fans and cinephiles alike. By immersing viewers in live events and cinematic experiences, virtual reality offers an exciting new dimension to the streaming revolution. As Meta and Peacock continue to collaborate and expand the partnership, the potential for the VR market to become a significant revenue driver for both companies becomes increasingly likely. As the technology continues to develop, virtual reality could transform the way we experience entertainment forever.
