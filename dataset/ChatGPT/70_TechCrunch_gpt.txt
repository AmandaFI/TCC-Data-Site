TechCrunch's Week in Review recaps the top stories from the tech world, with some of the biggest news coming from Twitter, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), and Google. Here's a brief overview of what happened:. Twitter's Bug Exposes Private Tweets. Twitter has been in the news again this week after a bug allowed private Circle tweets to surface on the For You timeline, causing several uncomfortable situations. The problem was fixed quickly, but it was an unwelcome reminder that our private information is never completely safe. In other Twitter news, CEO Elon Musk confirmed that he bought the company because he thought he would be forced to do so. Twitter's parent company has also been renamed X Corp, as Musk plans to build a super app called "X." The details of this app are unclear, but it's likely to include some form of social media, messaging, and payments. FTC Clamps Down on Review Hijackers. The US Federal Trade Commission ordered supplements retailer The Bountiful Company to pay $600,000 for review hijacking on Amazon. The company had been artificially boosting its ratings by offering free products in exchange for positive reviews. This is against Amazon's policies, and the FTC has been cracking down on such practices to protect consumers and preserve the integrity of online reviews. Google TV Adds More Streaming Content. Google TV updated its platform to provide access to more free, streaming content. This move is particularly significant given the recent rise of subscription-based streaming services like Netflix and Amazon Prime Video. With Google TV, users can now watch a wide range of movies and TV shows without having to pay a monthly fee. Truecaller Adds Live Caller ID Support. Stockholm-based Truecaller added a new feature that provides live caller ID support on iOS. This means that users can see who is calling them in real-time, even if the number isn't saved in their contacts. This is especially useful for avoiding spam calls and identifying unknown callers. GaeaStar's 3D-Printed Clay Containers. A startup called GaeaStar developed a special 3D-printer that churns out disposable containers made of clay, water, salt, and sand. The containers are eco-friendly, affordable, and can be used for food, drinks, and other products. They're also biodegradable, so they won't contribute to plastic waste in landfills. Android 14 Arrives. Google launched the first public beta release of Android 14, the latest version of its mobile operating system. The update includes several new features, such as improved privacy settings, faster performance, and better support for foldable devices. Android 14 is expected to be released to the public later this year. TechCrunch+ Exclusive Commentary.
