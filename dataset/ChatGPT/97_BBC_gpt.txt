Staffordshire's fixed speed cameras are to be upgraded with new digital technology, according to the county's Safety Partnership. The Staffordshire Safer Roads Partnership is assessing locations that would be best suited for the new devices, which are due to be installed later this year. The upgrade comes after the partnership's decision to replace older cameras that were due for renewal. The new cameras will have improved performance and will be more reliable in detecting speeding drivers. The new cameras will have improved digital technology that is expected to enhance enforcement efforts across the county. They will be capable of capturing high-quality colour images and will be weather-resistant. The technology will also include automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) software, which will make it easier to identify and prosecute speeding motorists. The Staffordshire Safer Roads Partnership has identified a number of locations where the new speed cameras could be deployed, including areas with high congestion such as A-roads and motorways. The partnership has also been working with local Road Safety Teams to identify locations with a high risk of speeding. Councillor Philip Hudson appealed for more police assistance for community speed watch groups in the county. He expressed concerns that existing community support officers lacked the powers to deal with speeding drivers. The partnership responded by stating that it was looking at ways in which policing could provide greater support to community speed watch groups, including training and support. The upgrade to the speed cameras and greater police support for community speed watch groups are part of a wider effort to improve road safety in Staffordshire. The partnership is committed to reducing the number of road accidents and casualties in the county. The partnership will continue to work with local authorities, police, and other organisations to promote safer roads and reduce the number of road accidents. The new cameras will be installed in the coming months, and the partnership is confident that they will help reduce the number of speeding drivers on Staffordshire's roads. With the latest digital technology installed, police will be able to enforce speed limits more rigorously, and the roads will become safer for all users.
