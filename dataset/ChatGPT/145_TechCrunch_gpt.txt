Cosmose AI, a Singapore-based company that uses AI analytics to track in-store foot traffic and engage with shoppers online, has partnered with blockchain protocol Near to develop a payment system that will allow users to shop with cryptocurrency. The new payment system will have low transaction fees and will be integrated into Cosmose's KaiKai app, which has processed over one million transactions in the form of payments, rewards, and refunds since launching the option to pay with cryptocurrency in Singapore in September 2020. The app uses Near's network and cryptocurrency Kai-Ching, which is pegged to US dollars and only tradable within the app, to settle payments. The partnership with Near comes as Cosmose is looking to expand its footprint in the fast-growing cryptocurrency market. Cosmose has been in operation since 2014, and it uses AI technology to monitor foot traffic in retail stores and shopping malls.

This will enable fast, secure, and low-cost transactions on the Near network, which is capable of processing up to 1,000 transactions per second. The move is expected to boost the adoption of cryptocurrency in Singapore, where the acceptance of digital currencies is still relatively low compared to other countries.
