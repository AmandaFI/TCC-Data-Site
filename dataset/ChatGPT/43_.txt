Another round of mass layoffs is expected to take place at Meta, the parent company of Facebook, this week. The company has confirmed that it will be letting go of employees as part of its broader restructuring initiative, known as the "year of efficiency", which is being spearheaded by CEO Mark Zuckerberg. The layoffs are expected to impact tech departments, while another round of job cuts is expected to hit the business side in May. It is predicted that Meta will cut around 4,000 jobs in total, as part of the 10,000 layoffs announced in March. Industry analysts suggest that teams working on projects within the Facebook app and Reality Labs, the unit dedicated to augmented and virtual reality experiences, may be among those affected by the job cuts. However, it is believed that those working on developing games will be safe for now, as Meta works on marketing its metaverse gamble to traditional gamers. The company has invested billions into its social VR platform, Horizon Worlds, which has only around 200,000 monthly active users. The news of the upcoming job cuts has been met with a mix of concern and frustration from industry insiders and stakeholders, who worry that the layoffs will have a significant impact on the company's morale and bottom line. Many workers have expressed their disappointment and frustration with the lack of transparency and communication from management about the restructuring process. The latest round of layoffs comes at a time when Meta is facing increased scrutiny and pressure from regulators and lawmakers around the world, who are concerned about the company's market dominance and privacy practices. The company is also facing a lawsuit from the US Federal Trade Commission, which alleges that it has engaged in anti-competitive practices. Despite the challenges facing the company, Meta has remained committed to its vision of building a metaverse, a virtual realm where users can interact with each other in immersive and seamless ways. The company has stated that it sees the metaverse as the next evolution of the internet, and is investing heavily in research and development to bring its vision to life. However, it remains to be seen whether the company's lofty ambitions will translate into success in the years to come.
