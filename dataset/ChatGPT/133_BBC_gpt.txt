The risk of future deaths caused by smart motorways has been highlighted by a coroner after an investigation into the death of a man in 2018. David Levett, 53, died from chest and head injuries following a crash on the M1 near Daventry in which a stationary car he was travelling in was hit. The coroner has warned that the crash could have been prevented if the hard shoulder had been active. Smart motorways are designed to ease congestion on busy roads by using the hard shoulder as an extra lane, but this has raised concerns over safety. Levett's case is the latest in a series of deaths linked to smart motorways, which have led to calls for them to be scrapped. The lorry driver involved in the crash, who has since fled to Turkey, was charged with causing death by dangerous driving. Levett's family expressed their frustration at the driver's escape, with one family member saying: "We're not getting any justice. We just want closure and to know what happened that day.". The coroner's report noted that there were no signs warning motorists of a stationary vehicle ahead, and that the hard shoulder had been closed for over four miles. The report also highlighted the need for better CCTV coverage and more trained personnel to monitor the motorway. In response to the report, the government recently announced the scrapping of new smart motorway plans, stating that "we will not be adding any further all lane running schemes to the network." However, campaigners have called for existing smart motorways to be retrofitted with an active hard shoulder to prevent future deaths. The coroner's findings have been met with concern from road safety experts. Edmund King, president of the Automobile Association (AA), said: "There is no doubt smart motorways have cost lives. We need to either upgrade the existing network or go back to the drawing board.". The Transport Secretary, Grant Shapps, has ordered a review into the safety of smart motorways, which is due to report back in the coming months. Speaking about the review, Shapps said: "We will work with experts to gather the evidence and make recommendations for improving the safety of smart motorways.". The death of David Levett has highlighted the need for urgent action on the safety of smart motorways. With calls for the retrofitting of active hard shoulders on existing smart motorways, the government and road safety organisations must come together to ensure that our roads are as safe as possible for all users.
