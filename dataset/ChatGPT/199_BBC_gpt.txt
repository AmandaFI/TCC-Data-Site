Major Legal Changes Needed for Driverless Car Era. A report from the law commissions for England and Wales, and Scotland has called for major legal changes to adapt to the era of autonomous cars. The report states that human drivers should not be held legally accountable for road safety in the age of driverless cars. Instead, the driver should be redefined as a "user-in-charge" with different legal responsibilities. If anything goes wrong, the company behind the driving system should be held responsible. The report also recommends the establishment of a new regime to determine whether a vehicle qualifies as self-driving. Currently, there is confusion surrounding the capabilities of different cars, leading to potential safety hazards. Car manufacturers must clearly differentiate between self-drive and driver-assist features. The report emphasizes that there should be no sliding scale of driverless capabilities—cars are either autonomous or not. Moreover, the report suggests that if any sort of monitoring is required—for example, in extreme weather conditions—the vehicle should not be considered autonomous, and current driving rules should apply. This recommendation aims to ensure that driverless cars are only deployed in conditions they are fully equipped to handle. Transport Minister Trudy Harrison has expressed the government's willingness to consider the recommendations. The Scottish and Welsh governments will also decide on whether to introduce legislation based on the report's findings. These legal changes are seen as crucial in establishing a clear framework for the introduction of autonomous vehicles on the road. Matthew Avery, chief research strategy officer at Thatcham Research, commended the report's recommendations, particularly the call for appropriate terminology to be used by carmakers. This is intended to prevent motorists from mistakenly believing their cars are fully self-driving. Avery predicts that the next year will witness the introduction of self-driving features in the UK. The Department for Transport already approved automated lane-keeping systems (ALKS) last year, which was the first type of hands-free driving to be legalized in the UK. However, this move has faced criticism, particularly directed at Tesla, a leading autonomous car developer. Tesla has been criticized for its marketing of Autopilot, which is similar to ALKS and considered level two on the five defined levels of self-driving cars. In a recent incident, a Tesla driver using Autopilot was charged with vehicular manslaughter after causing a fatal accident. The need for clear legal guidelines and proper marketing terminology surrounding autonomous vehicles has become increasingly important. As companies continue to develop and test driverless technology, it is crucial for laws and regulations to keep up with the rapid advancements. By redefining the role of the driver and holding companies responsible for any malfunctions or accidents, the report aims to establish accountability and improve road safety in the age of driverless cars.
