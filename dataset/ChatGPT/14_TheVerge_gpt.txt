Tech giant Apple has reportedly laid off a small number of employees from its retail store building and upkeep division, according to reports. While the company has remained tight-lipped about the exact numbers of those affected, industry insiders suggest that the figures are “likely very small”. The move marks a change in policy for Apple, which has traditionally avoided layoffs, making it stand out from other major tech companies. However, it appears that the decision to let some employees go has been made in order to improve operations, rather than to cut costs. Indeed, affected staff have been given until the end of the week to apply for other positions within the company, with severance pay of up to four months being offered to those who are unable to stay. Although the number of employees affected remains unknown, Apple has a workforce of over 100,000 people, so it is likely that any layoffs will impact only a small proportion of the company’s workforce. Nevertheless, the move has raised eyebrows among industry experts, who see it as an indication of a wider trend in the tech industry towards greater cost-cutting measures. The news of Apple’s layoffs comes at a time when the company is experiencing something of a dip in fortunes. Recently, the company has seen a falloff in sales of its flagship iPhone, with users increasingly opting for rival devices from companies such as Samsung and Huawei. The company’s share price has also fallen over the past year, as investors become increasingly concerned about the company’s future prospects. Whether or not the layoffs will turn out to be a blip on the radar for Apple, or the beginning of a wider trend remains to be seen. However, the company’s decision to take action in order to streamline its operations suggests that it is taking seriously the challenges posed by an increasingly competitive tech market.
