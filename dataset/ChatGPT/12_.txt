Use Russian money to rebuild Ukraine, says bank boss. The governor of Ukraine's Central Bank, Kyrylo Shevchenko, has called for frozen Russian assets to be used to rebuild Ukraine after the war. In a recent statement, Shevchenko urged for further financial sanctions to be imposed on Russia, including cutting card payments and suspending Russian access to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Shevchenko emphasized that every day that sanctions are delayed, it costs the lives of innocent civilians and children. He argued that Russia should eventually be made to pay for repairing the damage caused during the invasion. The governor stated that a large share of financing for the reconstruction efforts should be obtained as reparation from Russia, including the funds currently frozen in allied countries. Russia's foreign exchange reserves, estimated to be around $630 billion, are mostly held outside the country and effectively frozen by international sanctions. Shevchenko believes that this money could potentially be used for the much-needed reconstruction in Ukraine once the war is over. The conflict in Ukraine has taken a heavy toll on the country's infrastructure and economy. Cities and towns have been reduced to rubble, and thousands of people have been displaced from their homes. Rebuilding efforts will require significant investment, and given Ukraine's strained financial situation, relying on Russian funds seems like a practical solution. Additionally, Shevchenko discussed the challenges of maintaining Ukraine's financial system during the ongoing war. Despite the disruptions caused by the conflict, the governor reassured the public that electronic payments and ATMs are still functioning, and efforts are being made to ensure that cash is delivered to areas that are not active combat zones. This is crucial for the survival of the economy and the well-being of the Ukrainian people. The stability of Ukraine's banking system remains a priority for Shevchenko. He emphasized that despite the difficult circumstances, the system is still liquid and functioning, thanks to the resilience and dedication of the country's banking sector. The governor commended the efforts of the employees working tirelessly to keep the financial system operational, ensuring that people have access to their funds and can carry out essential transactions. While there have been ongoing discussions about imposing additional financial sanctions on Russia, there is also a need for international cooperation to facilitate the release of frozen assets. Shevchenko called on allied countries to work together in pressuring Russia to bear the responsibility for the devastation caused by its invasion. Rebuilding Ukraine after the war will require not only financial support but also political will and cooperation. The governor acknowledged the need for a united front against Russian aggression, emphasizing that the international community must stand together in support of Ukraine's sovereignty and its right to rebuild. Public opinion on the matter is divided. While some argue that using frozen Russian assets for reconstruction is a justified response to the damage caused, others express concerns about potential repercussions. They argue that relying on Russian funds could create dependency and lead to compromises in Ukraine's sovereignty. Finding a balance between utilizing frozen assets and maintaining Ukraine's independence will be crucial in shaping the country's future. As the conflict in Ukraine continues, the urgency to find sustainable solutions for rebuilding becomes increasingly important. Shevchenko's call to use frozen Russian assets offers a potential avenue for financing the reconstruction efforts. However, the path forward will require international cooperation, careful planning, and a commitment to preserving Ukraine's independence and sovereignty. Amidst the devastation and challenges, the Ukrainian people remain determined to rebuild their homeland, and leveraging frozen Russian assets could play a significant role in their pursuit of a better future.
