Fast-charge EV battery maker StoreDot has announced that it has secured the first close of its latest funding round, led by Vietnamese electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer VinFast. This Series D funding round is expected to raise up to $80 million and will be used to support the completion of StoreDot's research and development as well as the mass production scale-up of its extreme fast charging (XFC) battery technology. StoreDot's XFC battery technology relies on a silicon-based anode and claims to be capable of extremely fast charge rates, able to fully charge a vehicle in just a few minutes. This technology could significantly reduce charging times for EVs, addressing one of the main drawbacks compared to traditional gasoline-powered vehicles. The Israeli battery technology startup has already formed partnerships with industry giants including Daimler, Samsung, TDK, and Chinese battery mass manufacturer EVE Energy. These partnerships will further support the development and commercialization of StoreDot's XFC battery technology. This latest funding round includes participation from other notable investors such as bp ventures and Golden Energy Global Investment. Together, these investments will help StoreDot accelerate its plans for commercialization and enable it to meet the growing demand for fast-charging EV batteries. VinFast's participation as a lead investor highlights the strategic importance of fast-charging technology within the EV industry. As an EV manufacturer, VinFast recognizes that the ability to charge vehicles quickly is essential for widespread adoption. By investing in StoreDot's XFC battery technology, VinFast aims to enhance its EV offerings and provide a competitive advantage in the market. StoreDot's CEO, Dr. Doron Myersdorf, expressed his excitement about the investment from VinFast and the other investors, emphasizing their shared vision for the future of the industry. He believes that the funding will not only accelerate the development of StoreDot's technology but also help establish partnerships to drive the global adoption of fast-charging batteries. With the support of VinFast and other industry partners, StoreDot is well-positioned to transform the EV market by addressing one of the key challenges: charging infrastructure and times. By enabling rapid charging capabilities, StoreDot's XFC battery technology could help accelerate the transition to electric vehicles and pave the way for a more sustainable transportation future.
