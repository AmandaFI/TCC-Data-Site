Reigniting the Pentagon and Silicon Valley Partnership. The growing interconnectedness between the tech sector and global politics is raising concerns about the United States' technological leadership. Recent events involving Russia and China underscore the need for collaboration between the Department of Defense (DoD), academia, and the industry to address emerging technological threats to national security. One event that caused alarm was Russia's launch of an anti-satellite missile into low-earth orbit without warning. Not only did this endanger the International Space Station, but it also posed a long-term risk to satellites supporting critical infrastructure on Earth. Additionally, China's launch of a hypersonic missile highlighted the need for technological advancements to defend against new threats. In response to these challenges, the author argues that entrepreneurs and investors in emerging technology domains such as artificial intelligence, space, cybersecurity, and autonomous systems should collaborate with the Pentagon, academia, and industry. By building on the success of Silicon Valley, the United States can maintain its technological leadership. The DoD is already actively pursuing a technology modernization agenda that reflects the changing nature of warfare. The use of dual-use technologies, such as small satellites, self-driving cars, and swarming drones, can enhance both commercial and military capabilities. Additionally, leveraging the power of AI and machine learning can enable faster and better decision-making. One key aspect emphasized in the article is the need for business process reforms within the DoD. The current processes were established in the 1960s and focused on building large weapons platforms. However, in today's rapidly advancing commercial sector, the Pentagon needs to procure technologies that complement and integrate with these platforms. The article warns of intense competition among nations for technological preeminence in the upcoming decade. To maintain the lead, the author suggests building an Internet of Things in space, creating a global sensor network for real-time situational awareness, resilient communications infrastructure, and an autonomous force of sea, land, air, and space systems. Achieving this vision requires improved storage, management, and analytics of immense amounts of data, as well as enhanced protection against cyber vulnerabilities. Recognizing the need to break down institutional barriers, the DoD established the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) in 2015 to facilitate collaboration and bring innovative contracting mechanisms to the department. The DIU has already shown the power of this collaboration in accelerating product development and stimulating company growth. To maintain U.S. leadership in key technologies, the article argues for changes in the 60-year-old acquisition system. Instead of being the primary investor, the DoD needs to adapt and integrate commercial technology as a fast follower. The DIU advocates for accelerating the pace of change, removing barriers, and fostering collaboration between the triangle of business, academia, and government. In conclusion, the article highlights the importance of rebuilding the connection between the DoD and the commercial industry. This collaborative effort, which includes talent exchange, product acquisition, and open communication, can pave the way for a secure and prosperous future, akin to the birth of Silicon Valley. By harnessing the pioneering spirit of entrepreneurs and investors, the United States can maintain its technological leadership and protect national security in an increasingly complex world.
