Ukraine crisis: Russian News Agency Deletes Victory Editorial. In a surprising turn of events, Russian news agency RIA-Novosti published and subsequently removed an article that prematurely praised Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Titled "The arrival of Russia in a new world," the article applauds Russian President Vladimir Putin for his military action in resolving the Ukraine "problem." It suggests that the author expected a swift victory and the piece was published prematurely. The article goes on to claim that Russia is returning to lead a new world order and justifies the ongoing "virtual civil war" in Ukraine as Russia restoring its historical fullness and gathering the Russian world together. It implies a Russian plan to increase its sphere of influence by uniting Russians, Belarusians, and Ukrainians. The author praises Putin for taking historic responsibility in resolving the Ukrainian question and concludes by asserting that Russia's military action represents the nation's return to its historical space and rightful place in the world, which undermines Western global domination. The publication of this article is seen as a significant shift in the Russian tone regarding the invasion in state-controlled media. It emphasizes the underlying motivation of returning Ukraine to its natural state as part of the Russian world. However, with the invasion progressing slower than expected, it appears that this narrative has been quietly shelved. State-run media in Russia continues to portray the invasion as a special military operation aimed at supporting Russian-backed rebels and de-Nazifying Ukraine. This perspective is consistent with the official state narrative. It is likely that the publication of the deleted article was an oversight, possibly due to miscommunication or a misjudgment of the timing. Coinciding with the expected timing of a quick victory, the publication of the article has raised speculation that it was planned in advance. Critics argue that it was meant to bolster domestic support for the invasion by presenting it as an inevitable success. However, with the invasion encountering unexpected challenges and facing international condemnation, this narrative has seemingly been discarded. In response to the article's publication, Russia's media regulator has imposed restrictions on Russian users' access to Facebook and Twitter. The regulator cited protest against censorship by the social media platforms as the reason behind the restrictions. This move further highlights the Russian government's efforts to control the flow of information and shape the narrative surrounding the invasion. The deletion of the victory editorial underscores the complexities and challenges faced by state-controlled media in Russia. It reveals a careful balancing act between maintaining domestic support for the invasion and managing international perceptions. The removal of the article suggests that the Russian government recognizes the need to adjust its messaging and portray the invasion in a more cautious light. As the conflict in Ukraine continues, it remains to be seen how the Russian government will frame its actions moving forward. The deleted article represents a glimpse into the inner workings of the state-controlled media and the ongoing efforts to shape public opinion. As the invasion unfolds, both domestic and international observers will closely scrutinize the media landscape in Russia for further insights into the government's narrative and strategies.
