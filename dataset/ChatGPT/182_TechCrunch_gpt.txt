Early-stage fintech startups just got a new funding source. The Interchange, a fintech newsletter, announced today two new additions to their team. Christine Hall will be co-writing with Mary Ann Azevedo, and a graphic designer, Bryce Durbin, has created a new logo for the newsletter. The announcement comes as the Interchange reports on the progress of the fintech industry, including the formation of a new female-led venture capital firm, Vesey Ventures. Vesey, founded by three former managing directors of Amex Ventures, plans to invest in fintech start-ups at the seed to Series B stages. The firm raised a $78m debut fund that will enable it to invest in a broad definition of fintech categories beyond traditional areas. The Interchange reports that the first quarter of 2023 saw $15bn in fintech funding, up 55% from the previous quarter. This growth is largely due to a $6.5bn contribution from Stripe. While Egypt-based MNT-Halan was the only company to achieve unicorn status this quarter, there was a 179% increase in the number of deals valued at $100m or more. This indicates a growing interest in the fintech industry. Apple also made headlines this quarter with its launch of a new savings account, offered in partnership with Goldman Sachs. Customers are being offered an APY of 4.15%, which has attracted a significant amount of interest. However, Moody's Investors Service has warned that incumbent banks and cash alternatives could suffer as a result of Apple's offering. The news of Vesey's debut fund will be welcome news for early-stage fintech start-ups who are looking for funding. The firm plans to invest in companies that are still in the nascent stages of development, providing them with the resources they need to grow and succeed. Vesey also boasts a broad definition of fintech categories, which will enable it to invest in areas beyond traditional fintech categories. This is a significant advantage for start-ups that may fall outside the scope of other venture capital firms. The Interchange's report on the first quarter of 2023 shows that the fintech industry is continuing to grow at an impressive rate. With a $15bn influx of funding, it is clear that investors are interested in fintech start-ups and are willing to provide the capital they need to succeed. While some may see Apple's new savings account as a threat to incumbent banks and cash alternatives, Vesey's debut fund is a reminder that there is still plenty of room for innovation in the fintech industry. The addition of Christine Hall and Bryce Durbin to the Interchange is further evidence of the growth and potential of the fintech industry. As the industry continues to evolve and develop, it is clear that there will be many opportunities for those who are willing to take risks and innovate.
