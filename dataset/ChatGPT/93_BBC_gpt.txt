Google faces new multi-billion advertising lawsuit. Tech giant Google is facing another legal battle in the UK over online advertising practices. The lawsuit, which was filed by former Guardian technology editor Charles Arthur, aims to secure £3.4bn ($4.2bn) in compensation for publishers for lost revenue. The case alleges that Google took unlawful advantage of its dominant position in online advertising, reducing the amount publishers could earn. This is the second lawsuit filed against Google over its adtech practices, following a claim launched by ex-Ofcom director Claudio Pollack in November 2020. Pollack is seeking damages of up to £13.6bn from the technology company over adtech. Both lawsuits focus on Google's role in deciding which online advertisements its users see, how much they cost, and how much publishers earn from them. Publishers argue that online advertising is their main source of revenue, and they accuse Google of unfairly manipulating the market. Arthur and Pollack are seeking to have their lawsuits certified as "opt-out," which means all relevant publishers would be included unless they choose to opt-out. Google denies any wrongdoing and has stated that it will defend itself vigorously against the claims. The company believes that its adtech practices are fair and transparent, and it has previously stated that it provides publishers with a range of tools and services that help them to earn more from their content. The outcome of the lawsuits could have significant implications for the online advertising industry. Google is a major player in the sector, and any legal action against the company could lead to changes in how online advertisements are managed and priced. The cases will likely take several years to reach a conclusion, and the outcome is far from certain. Online advertising has become an increasingly important part of the economy in recent years, with many publishers relying on it to fund their businesses. The growth of digital advertising has also led to concerns about the power of big tech companies like Google and Facebook, which have come under increased scrutiny in recent years over their market dominance and potential anti-competitive practices. The lawsuits against Google are part of a wider trend of legal action against big tech companies, with regulators and governments around the world looking to rein in the power of these companies. The European Union has been particularly active in this area, issuing antitrust fines against Google and other tech giants in recent years. In the UK, the lawsuits against Google are likely to be watched closely by both publishers and regulators. The country's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has been investigating the digital advertising sector for some time, and it is expected to make recommendations for reforms later this year. The CMA's investigation has focused on concerns about the market power of big tech companies, as well as issues around transparency and competition. The regulator has stated that it is particularly concerned about the role of platforms like Google and Facebook in the digital advertising ecosystem. The outcome of the lawsuits against Google could have significant implications for the CMA's investigation, as well as for the wider digital advertising industry. Publishers will be hoping that the legal action will lead to changes in how online advertisements are managed and priced, while Google will be determined to defend its position in the market. The lawsuits are likely to be long and complex, and it could be several years before a final decision is reached. However, the cases represent another challenge for one of the world's biggest tech companies, and they highlight the growing pressure on big tech firms to operate in a more transparent and competitive manner.
