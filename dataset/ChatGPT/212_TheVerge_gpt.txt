Apple has made a new announcement regarding its COVID-19 policies for employees, as the company now requires all its store and corporate workers to receive a COVID-19 booster shot. The decision was communicated through an internal email sent to Apple employees, informing them that once they become eligible for a booster shot, they will have four weeks to comply. Failure to do so will result in the employee needing to undergo frequent COVID-19 tests in order to enter a retail store, partner store, or Apple office starting on February 15th. Furthermore, Apple will also be implementing additional measures for unvaccinated employees or those who have not provided proof of vaccination. Beginning on January 24th, these individuals will need to provide negative COVID-19 rapid antigen tests before entering the workplace. However, it remains uncertain whether this requirement applies to both corporate and retail employees. Apple justified its decision to mandate booster shots by citing the waning efficacy of the primary series of COVID-19 vaccines and the emergence of highly transmissible variants like Omicron. The company believes that booster shots are crucial in ensuring that employees are up to date with their COVID-19 vaccination and providing protection against severe illness. Previously, Apple had implemented testing protocols for unvaccinated employees, with daily tests required for corporate workers and twice-weekly tests for retail staff. Vaccinated individuals were also subject to regular testing, albeit at a reduced frequency. However, it appears that Apple's relaxed testing policy will no longer be applicable to employees who fail to receive the booster shot within the company's specified timeframe. In a similar vein, Meta, formerly known as Facebook, recently announced that its employees must also receive a COVID-19 booster shot before the company's return to in-office work in March. In contrast, Google has not yet made booster shots mandatory for its employees. However, the company does require individuals to have received the first two doses of a COVID-19 vaccine. Additionally, Google employees are subject to regular weekly molecular tests. It remains to be seen whether other companies will follow Apple and Meta's lead in mandating booster shots for their employees as the fight against COVID-19 continues.
