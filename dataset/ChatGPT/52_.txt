Microsoft has announced the integration of its Bing chatbot into its popular SwiftKey smartphone keyboard app available on both Android and iOS devices. The move is expected to make the user experience more seamless, offering more detailed queries while on the move. The Bing chatbot is being used on SwiftKey in three ways: Chat, Tone and Search. The Chat feature allows users to make more detailed queries on Bing even while on the go. Once the user has typed in their query, Bing can offer various search results, suggestions or even help users out with puns. For example, if a user is puzzled about what to pair a certain dessert with, Bing can suggest a specific dish that will make the perfect pairing even on the move. The Tone feature is another innovative integration of AI technology that SwiftKey users will find useful. It uses AI to adapt a user's writing style for any situation, making formal emails and professional text messages easier to craft. The SwiftKey app analyzes the context of the writing to accurately rephrase sentences, replacing casual words with more appropriate phrasing, thereby elevating the text to a more professional tone. The Search feature allows SwiftKey users to access the internet on the go with ease. Instead of leaving the app just to initiate a search action, SwiftKey brings the search action to the keyboard. Using the Search feature, users can effortlessly access the web to get information on the various topics they need information on. However, users will need to sign in with their Microsoft account to use the Bing chatbot features. For obvious reasons, Microsoft wants its collection of services to be more intertwined and seamless for users to navigate. Once signed in, SwiftKey users will have access to the full range of Bing chatbot features, including those powered by AI. The announcement by Microsoft comes not long after the company acquired SwiftKey in 2016. While chatbots, AI and voice assistants have become ubiquitous of late, the integration of intelligence on platforms like SwiftKey has not been well found. The key selling point of SwiftKey has always been its ability to suggest the next word or the whole sentence, making typing easier. Microsoft has been slowly ramping up developments on their Bing search engine on multiple fronts. The Bing chatbot integration into SwiftKey is one more concrete evidence of their unequivocal commitment to refreshing and innovating the search engine. For every tech company, a good mobile app is the Holy Grail that is worth pursuing. It is not surprising that Microsoft sees the SwiftKey app as an essential part of its strategy moving forward. As things stand, SwiftKey is one of the most downloaded keyboard apps in the market, with more than 500 million downloads on the Google Play Store alone. Even more significant for Microsoft is the fact that the keyboard app remains popular with users who are looking for more customization options. SwiftKey offers its users several customization options that allow them to phone-tune the keyboard's behavior to their typing style. And now, with the added Bing chatbot feature, SwiftKey is offering users even more options to make their typing experience more personalized. In conclusion, the integration of Bing into SwiftKey marks yet another significant milestone in Microsoft's ongoing efforts to improve and innovate its services. As AI and machine learning continue to grow, it is likely that we will see more of this sort of integration in the future. For now, SwiftKey users can enjoy the added benefits that Bing brings to their conversations through the keyboard app.
