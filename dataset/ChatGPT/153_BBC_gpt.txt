Infosys, the Indian multinational technology company, has announced the closure of its office in Moscow amidst growing pressure to halt its operations in Russia following the invasion of Ukraine. The company, which is one of India's largest, had established an engineering center in Moscow in 2016 and employed around 100 staff members. While many global IT firms suspended their operations in Russia following the invasion, Infosys had continued to maintain a small team there until now. The decision to close the Moscow office comes amid increasing scrutiny of UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak's wife, Akshata Murty, who owns shares in Infosys worth over Â£400 million. The Labour Party and Liberal Democrats have raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest, as Sunak has been vocal about the need for UK businesses to divest from Russia. Critics argue that it is important for the public to know whether the chancellor's household benefits from a company that invests in Russia. In response to the allegations, Sunak has defended his wife, stating that his family has no involvement in the operational decisions of Infosys. He maintains that his position as chancellor is completely separate from his wife's shareholding in the company. However, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer argues that the public has a right to know about any potential financial ties that could influence government decisions. The closure of Infosys' Moscow office is seen as a step towards addressing the concerns raised by political parties and ensuring that there are no conflicts of interest. The company is now focused on finding alternative roles for its employees in other locations. This move not only serves as a way to distance Infosys from Russia during these politically sensitive times but also reflects the company's commitment to its employees by trying to secure their employment elsewhere. The closure of the Moscow office is expected to have minimal impact on Infosys' overall operations, as it only housed a small team. However, it does raise questions about the future of the company's presence in Russia. Many multinational corporations are reassessing their investments and operations in the country due to geopolitical tensions and potential economic repercussions. The closure of Infosys' Moscow office also sheds light on the broader issue of UK businesses divesting from Russia. With the invasion of Ukraine and ongoing conflicts in the region, there is increasing pressure on companies to reconsider their ties with the Russian market. This decision by Infosys could set a precedent for other firms as they navigate the complex and politically sensitive landscape. As the controversy surrounding Chancellor Rishi Sunak's wife continues to unfold, it remains to be seen whether further investigations will be carried out into her financial ties to Infosys. The Labour Party and Liberal Democrats are expected to push for greater transparency in order to ensure that there are no conflicts of interest in the chancellor's decision-making process. Meanwhile, the closure of the Moscow office stands as a clear indication that Infosys is taking steps to distance itself from Russia and address any potential concerns regarding its operations in the country.
