Apple captures nearly half of global refurbished smartphone market. Market research firm Counterpoint Research has revealed that Apple's sales of refurbished iPhones grew 16% year-on-year in 2022, with the company capturing over 49% of the global secondary smartphone market. This helped Apple become the fastest-growing brand in the used and refurbished markets. The significant demand for refurbished iPhones has led to a dip in sales of new iPhones and Apple's service revenues in many markets. The refurbished smartphone market is a fast-growing segment, driven by consumers who are looking for more affordable options that are still high-quality. This is particularly true in emerging markets, where the cost of a new iPhone can be prohibitive. Refurbished smartphones offer many of the same features and functionality as a new device, but at a significantly lower price point. Apple has been able to capitalize on this trend by offering high-quality refurbished devices through its own channels and via third-party retailers. The company has also implemented a rigorous refurbishment process that ensures that each device is fully tested and refurbished to meet Apple's strict quality standards. Apple's success in the refurbished smartphone market is having an impact on its overall sales and service revenues. As consumers opt for refurbished devices instead of buying new, Apple is experiencing a decline in sales of new iPhones in some markets. Additionally, as refurbished iPhones are typically sold at lower price points, Apple's service revenues are also being impacted. Counterpoint Research's report also reveals that Samsung saw a dip in the secondary market, with its share dropping from 28% in 2021 to 26% in 2022. This is partly due to a small percentage of Android consumers shifting to iOS. However, Samsung still maintains a strong presence in the refurbished smartphone market, with a range of high-quality devices on offer. One emerging trend in the refurbished smartphone market is the increasing demand for 5G handsets. Counterpoint Research notes that 5G made up 13% of global refurbished smartphone sales in 2022, indicating that consumers are keen to take advantage of the faster speeds and lower latency that 5G networks offer. Overall, the refurbished smartphone market is a growing segment that offers many opportunities for device OEMs like Apple and Samsung. By offering high-quality refurbished devices at lower price points, these companies can tap into new markets and reach consumers who may not be able to afford a new device. However, as the trend towards refurbished devices continues, device OEMs will need to adapt their sales and service strategies to stay competitive in this fast-changing market.
