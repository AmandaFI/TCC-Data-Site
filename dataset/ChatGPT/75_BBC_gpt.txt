Lytham man sentenced to 29 months for hacking into woman's social media accounts and stealing private images. Sam Partington, a 30-year-old man from Lytham, UK has been sentenced to 29 months in jail for hacking into a woman's Facebook and Snapchat accounts and stealing private images. The action has violated both the Computer Misuse Act and the Data Protection Act. Partington has reportedly locked the unnamed woman out of her social media accounts and made copies of the images on her profile and conversations from Snapchat. Furthermore, investigations which followed have also revealed that Partington's devices contained indecent images of children. The case began when the woman discovered that she was locked out of her accounts and observed that personal pictures and information had been taken. She was ultimately forced to seek the help of the police, and officers were able to track the internet footprint back to Partington. Sentencing Partington to 29 months in jail, Judge Robert Altham reportedly insisted that his crimes were motivated by "sexual gratification." In addition, a 10-year restraining order was issued, preventing Partington from contacting the victim after his release. Detective Constable Jon Hill emphasized that the case is an alarming reminder of how technology can be used as a weapon to exert control, and that the sentence will serve as a deterrent to offenders and send a clear message to victims. Hill also urged people to take steps to protect themselves online, saying: "always protect your passwords, use two-factor authentication and think about what you're uploading and sharing with others.". This is not the first time that cybercrime has been punished by the law. In fact, the UK has introduced new laws recently to prevent cybercrime and hacking into personal accounts. In one such case last year, a man was sentenced to 18 months after hacking into a teenage girl's Snapchat account and blackmailing her. It is imperative to take caution while using social media accounts, as they contain personal information which can have severe consequences if stolen.
