Swiftly, a retail technology company, has secured $100 million in a Series B funding round led by Wormhole Capital, bringing its total funding to $120 million. The company provides technology tools to brick-and-mortar retailers, enabling them to compete with e-commerce giants such as Amazon and Walmart. With its platform, Swiftly offers mobile technology capabilities, analytics, and advertising to engage shoppers digitally, making in-store shopping as convenient as online. Swiftly is already used by hundreds of consumer brands in nearly 10,000 store locations, representing over $30 billion in gross merchandise volume. Now, with the additional funding, the company plans to expand its services to new verticals outside of grocery retail, including beauty, home improvement, and sporting goods. This move marks Swiftly's strategic goal of becoming a leading provider of retail technology solutions across various industries. Traditional retailers have been faced with numerous challenges in recent years due to the rise of e-commerce. However, Swiftly's CEO, Henry Kim, believes that brick-and-mortar retailers still possess a distinct advantage in capturing customer loyalty and using digital tools to recapture customers faster than e-commerce companies. With Swiftly's technology, retailers can bridge the gap between online and in-store shopping experiences, creating a seamless omnichannel experience for customers. The funding round led by Wormhole Capital underscores the confidence investors have in Swiftly's ability to disrupt the retail landscape. Wormhole Capital, a venture capital firm focused on technology companies, recognized the value of Swiftly's platform in helping retailers adapt to the changing consumer landscape. Other investors in the round included existing backers, such as XYZ Ventures and Venture Capital Partners, who have continued to support Swiftly's growth. This new capital injection will provide the resources needed for Swiftly to expand its operations and accelerate its growth in new verticals. The company plans to further enhance its technology platform, improving its mobile capabilities, analytics, and advertising solutions to deliver an even better customer experience. Swiftly aims to create a comprehensive suite of tools that empower retailers to effectively compete with e-commerce giants. With its focus on expanding beyond the grocery retail sector, Swiftly aims to cater to the unique needs of other industries. By offering tailored solutions to beauty, home improvement, and sporting goods retailers, Swiftly hopes to become an essential partner for businesses looking to thrive in the digital age. By leveraging Swiftly's platform, retailers can reach customers through personalized advertisements, offer convenient mobile shopping experiences, and gain valuable insights through data analytics.
