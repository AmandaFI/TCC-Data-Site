Ford launches hands-free driving on UK motorways. Ford has launched its BlueCruise technology in the UK, allowing drivers to legally take their hands off the wheel on certain motorways while the car controls steering, acceleration, and braking. The technology monitors the driver's eyes to keep them alert and it will first become available on 2023 models of Ford's electric Mustang Mach-E SUV. The system is classified as Level 2 driver assistance, meaning the driver must stay alert at all times. BlueCruise uses cameras and sensors to detect other cars, lane markings and speed signs. It will only work on 2,300 miles of pre-mapped motorways across England, Scotland, and Wales that have been deemed safe, and has a maximum speed of 80 mph. . The technology has already been available in the US and Canada, where it has not been involved in any accidents in the 60 million miles covered by more than 190,000 cars. . Ford stated that the BlueCruise system will reduce driver fatigue on long journeys and improve safety on motorways. It will also reduce emissions as the car is driving more efficiently and smoothly. . The UK's Department for Transport has granted approval for the system and said it will monitor its use to ensure it is being used safely. . Ford's President and CEO, Jim Farley, said, "The Mustang Mach-E's hands-free capability is a milestone achievement for the entire Ford team. It's an all-electric SUV that's fun to drive, with room for your family and friends and it's got one of the most innovative driver-assist technologies available in any electric vehicle today – Ford BlueCruise.". The move comes as the UK government aims to make the country a leader in autonomous driving technology, with the UK's self-driving vehicle sector predicted to be worth £42 billion by 2035. Ford's announcement has been welcomed by safety organizations, with the AA stating that it should increase safety on UK roads. Edmund King, AA President, said, "This inspirational technology will benefit drivers who have to drive long distances, particularly those driving home from a night shift. It will also be of benefit to those who have to commute long distances or have to transport family and friends on motorways.". However, the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA) warned that drivers must remain vigilant and not become complacent when using the system. Nick Lloyd, Head of Road Safety at RoSPA, said: "While driver assistance systems can improve safety, and reduce fatigue and stress, they must be used correctly, in the right conditions, by those drivers for whom they are intended.". The introduction of hands-free systems comes amid concerns over driver distraction and safety on UK roads. In 2019, there were 1,752 reported road deaths in the UK, with a further 25,945 reported serious injuries. Distracted driving was the cause of 4% of fatal accidents and 8% of all accidents that resulted in injury. . The UK's Highway Code requires drivers to "remain in full control of their vehicle at all times" and to "refrain from any action which distracts them from driving." However, with the advent of autonomous driving technology, there have been calls for the code to be updated to reflect new driving practices. The UK government is currently conducting a review of the Highway Code, which includes proposals for new guidance on the use of hands-free technology. The review aims to ensure the code reflects the latest advances in vehicle technology, to improve road safety and better protect vulnerable road users such as cyclists and pedestrians. In conclusion, the launch of Ford's BlueCruise technology in the UK represents a significant milestone for autonomous driving technology in the country. While the system does have the potential to increase safety and improve driver comfort on long journeys, it is important that drivers remain vigilant and adhere to the Highway Code. With the UK government reviewing the code's guidance on the use of hands-free technology, it is vital that the industry and regulators work together to ensure that autonomous driving technology is integrated safely and effectively into UK roads.
