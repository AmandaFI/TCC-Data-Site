North Yorkshire Council has made a commitment to make electric vehicle (EV) charging points easily accessible to all its residents, in spite of the challenges that come with rural areas. The council has said that it is determined to make travelling via electric vehicles easier and encourage environmentally-friendly transport initiatives. According to reports, the council has already secured an impressive £2.2m in funding to provide 70 EV charging points in the county. These charging points will be powered by battery storage units that are, in turn, charged by solar panels. This system is expected to greatly reduce carbon emissions and lower the impact on the environment. North Yorkshire Council says that it’s not just interested in providing charging points in central urban areas, but has also promised to extend this initiative to more rural parts of the county. They want to install EV charge points in both residential areas and at larger “charging hubs”. The council’s ambitious plans, which are already underway, are to ensure that electric vehicle owners receive the same level of debate as those travelling in non-EVs. To achieve this, the North Yorkshire Council has promised to install one electric vehicle charger for every ten petrol or diesel refuelling stations. The launch of this new initiative is, however, a staggering undertaking, as it’s estimated that more than 3,000 charging points will be needed to accommodate the growing number of electric vehicles and their owners by 2030. Currently, the county already boasts over 4,000 registered EVs and 225 publicly-operational charging points. Councillor Don Mackenzie, executive member for access at North Yorkshire Council, says that they are working hard to ensure that electric vehicle owners in the county can enjoy all the benefits that come with their cars, including the ability to easily recharge them when necessary. Mackenzie adds that the council is committed to reducing carbon emissions and that this initiative is part of their overall efforts to be environmentally conscious and promote sustainable travel. The council’s proactive approach is sure to encourage more EV drivers in the UK, especially as the government has already announced that it is phasing out petrol cars by 2035. This means that councils and other government entities need to encourage EV adoption by providing charging points for their local communities. However, this is a costly undertaking, and most councils will have to rely on external funding to accomplish this. North Yorkshire Council’s successful securing of funding for 70 EV charging points is an excellent example of how local authorities can be proactive in securing funds for these initiatives.
