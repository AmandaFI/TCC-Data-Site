Hugging Face, an AI startup that focuses on natural language processing, has released its own open-source version of ChatGPT, the AI-powered chatbot developed by OpenAI. The new chatbot is called HuggingChat and it was built using the model developed by Open Assistant, which aims to create an open assistant capable of performing "meaningful work.". According to Hugging Face, HuggingChat is designed to handle a wide range of tasks, including composing rap lyrics, writing code, and drafting emails. However, like many text-generating models, HuggingChat can be derailed easily depending on the questions asked. The company has released the model as an open-source project, meaning that anyone can access and contribute to its development. Hugging Face's decision to release an open-source chatbot similar to ChatGPT has been met with some criticism from researchers. Some have raised concerns about the potential malicious use of such models. However, the company maintains that its goal is to create tools that will help people in their daily lives. "By releasing HuggingChat as an open-source project, we hope to help advance the field of natural language processing and make it more accessible to researchers and developers," said Clement Delangue, CEO of Hugging Face. HuggingChat is built on top of the GPT model architecture, which is a type of neural network that generates human-like text. The model was trained on a dataset of over 1.5 billion words, making it more accurate and versatile than previous models. The release of HuggingChat is part of a growing trend in the AI industry towards creating more accessible and open-source tools. Other recent releases include StableLM by Stability AI, which is a powerful language model that has been designed to be more stable and resistant to adversarial attacks. Despite the fact that HuggingChat is an open-source project, Hugging Face is still committed to providing support and guidance to developers who want to use the model. The company has provided detailed documentation and tutorials on its website, along with a dedicated forum for developers to ask questions and share ideas. Hugging Face is one of the fastest-growing AI startups in the industry, with a range of products designed to make natural language processing more accessible and powerful. The company has raised over $110 million in funding to date and has partnerships with some of the world's biggest technology companies. The release of HuggingChat is a significant milestone for the company, and it is likely to attract a lot of attention from researchers and developers in the AI industry. The company's commitment to creating open-source tools that help make natural language processing more accessible is likely to be a game-changer in the industry and could help to drive further innovation and progress in the field.
