Walmart-backed fintech firm, PhonePe, is preparing to launch a dedicated app store for Android users in India, in a bid to take on Google's dominance in the market. The move comes shortly after the acquisition of app store maker IndusOS, which had previously partnered with smartphone vendors to provide localized services to customers. The new app store is set to offer multilingual solutions to help developers with "high-quality" user acquisition, while also providing hyper-localized services based on customer context. PhonePe's app store will support 12 languages and offer 24x7 live chat, with a "premiere experience" designed to draw in users through targeted advertising. With Google dominating the smartphone operating system market in India, PhonePe's move seeks to challenge the tech giant's monopoly on app distribution and provide a new alternative for users. As one of India's leading digital payment providers, with over 250 million registered users in the country, PhonePe has the potential to attract a substantial user base for its app store. The company also plans to leverage its existing partnerships with merchants and service providers to promote its app store and attract users with its hyper-localized offerings. The acquisition of IndusOS is expected to play a key role in PhonePe's app store strategy, enabling the firm to provide localized services and multilingual solutions for developers. IndusOS had previously partnered with smartphone brands such as Samsung, Micromax, and Intex to offer an app store and additional services to users. By acquiring IndusOS, PhonePe aims to leverage its existing partnerships and expand its reach to new customers, while also improving its offerings to existing users. The new app store is expected to compete with Google's Play Store, which currently dominates the Indian market with over 98% of app downloads. However, PhonePe's hyper-localized offering and multilingual support may give it an advantage in targeting specific segments of the market. The company's focus on enabling developers to acquire high-quality users through its app store, along with its targeted advertising approach, will also aim to set it apart from Google's Play Store. Furthermore, PhonePe's app store could potentially be integrated into its existing payment and digital commerce offerings, providing a seamless experience for users. This would further enhance the company's offerings and make it a one-stop destination for users looking for localized services, digital payments, and e-commerce. The launch of PhonePe's app store also marks a shift in focus for the company, which has primarily been focused on digital payments and financial services. However, the company sees the new venture as an opportunity to expand its offerings and provide greater value to its users. With the growing popularity of digital services in India, PhonePe's app store is expected to appeal to a wide range of users and provide a new source of revenue for the company. In conclusion, PhonePe's move to launch a dedicated app store in India represents a significant challenge to Google's dominance in the market. With its hyper-localized offerings, multilingual support, and targeted advertising approach, the app store has the potential to attract a substantial user base and provide a new alternative for users looking for specific services. The acquisition of IndusOS provides PhonePe with the expertise and partnerships needed to create a successful app store, while the potential integration with its existing digital payment and e-commerce offerings will further enhance the value proposition for users. As digital services continue to grow in popularity in India, PhonePe's app store is poised to be a major player in the market.
