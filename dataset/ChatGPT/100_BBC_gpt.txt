Ukraine is rapidly expanding its 'Army of Drones' for front line use, with the government increasing production in order to meet demand on the front line. The most commonly used drone is the DJI Mavic, which is relatively low cost and offers a good level of performance. In order to achieve this, the government has relaxed import laws and scrapped taxes for drone parts and equipment through a fundraising campaign called the Army of Drones. The campaign has been hugely successful so far - raising over $108m (Â£87m) - with support from celebrities such as Mark Hamill. Hundreds of small and relatively cheap drones have reportedly been banned in Ukraine and Russia after its Chinese manufacturer declared they were "for civilian use only." This has ensured that the drones being used by Ukraine's military are all high quality and fit for purpose. Ukrainian drone pilots are also being trained using the Army of Drones funds, with some 400 people in Ukraine sending their hobby drones to help bolster the country's drone fleet. The campaign leaders claim to have built or purchased 3,300 drones with the funds. The use of drones has proved to be a significant tool for Ukraine in its ongoing conflict with Russia. Drone strikes on Russian soil have been reported, but the government has refused to comment on these allegations. The use of drones has enabled Ukraine to conduct reconnaissance missions and gather intelligence on Russian forces, as well as carry out strikes on key targets. The Army of Drones campaign is just one example of the way in which Ukraine is learning to adapt and innovate in order to face the challenges it currently faces. With tensions between Ukraine and Russia still high, the use of technology such as drones is becoming increasingly important. Ukraine has been at war with Russian-backed separatists in the eastern part of the country since 2014, and fighting has continued sporadically ever since. Despite a ceasefire being in place since 2015, clashes continue to occur. The conflict has claimed the lives of over 10,000 people and displaced more than 1.6 million. The use of drones has the potential to significantly alter the dynamic of the conflict. While Russia has its own drone capabilities, the ongoing sanctions against it have limited its ability to acquire new technology. Ukraine, on the other hand, has been able to develop its own drone capabilities thanks to the Army of Drones campaign. The drones used by Ukraine are not just reliant on military-grade technology. Rather, the use of hobby drones has enabled the country to create a large and diverse fleet, with a range of different models tailored to specific tasks. This has also allowed for the training of a large number of drone pilots, creating a valuable skillset that can be used in future conflicts. The Army of Drones campaign has also enabled the creation of a new industry in Ukraine, with a number of companies now manufacturing and selling their own drones. This has created jobs and driven economic growth, even in the midst of ongoing conflict. While drones may not offer a complete solution to the problems faced by Ukraine, they have certainly provided a valuable asset in the country's ongoing struggle with Russia. As the technology continues to develop, it could offer new and innovative ways to conduct warfare, providing Ukraine with a vital advantage in a complex and ever-changing battlefield.
