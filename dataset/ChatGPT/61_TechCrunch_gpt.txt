Credable, a Dubai-based fintech startup that aims to bring affordable banking services to unbanked individuals in emerging markets, has raised $2.5m in seed funding. The company has already generated $5m in disbursed loans and $3m in savings products, serving over 1.2 million customers in Tanzania, Kenya, and Uganda. Founded in 2019 by Nadeem Juma, Jad Abbas, and Michael Tarimo, Credable is built on a revenue-sharing model that enables it to partner with balance sheet providers to create an end-to-end solution. This enables businesses to provide financial services to customers who are usually excluded from traditional banking. The startup has created a digital banking infrastructure that offers services such as savings products, asset financing, and affordable loans. The end-to-end solution integrates tech-enabled know-your-customer (KYC) and money laundering checks, making it easier for businesses to offer financial services to customers. Credable has a mission of empowering the unbanked population in emerging markets by giving them the opportunity to access financial services. This is especially important given that many financial institutions in these markets have strict requirements for customers to access banking services. Such requirements often exclude low-income earners who cannot provide the necessary documentation or have a minimum income requirement. Credable bridges this gap by partnering with a range of digital providers to enable businesses to offer financial services to low-income earners. The revenue-sharing model allows the startup to provide affordable services, with customers paying a percentage of their income to the platform. The seed funding will enable Credable to expand its operations and reach more customers. It will also help the company to create more partnerships with balance sheet providers and digital banking platforms to reach more businesses. Credable plans to use the funding to scale its operations and integrate more services. In the near future, the platform hopes to offer payment services, asset management tools, and insurance products to its customers. The startup aims to build a Unit that will serve the entire emerging market by establishing partnerships with financial institutions, businesses, and governments. This approach will enable more unbanked individuals to access financial services and create a more inclusive economy. Credable's founders believe that their approach will revolutionize the banking industry, especially in emerging markets. They are optimistic that the digital infrastructure they have built will enable them to reach millions of people who are currently excluded from traditional banking services. The seed funding round was led by Equator Capital Partners, a New York-based impact investment firm. Other investors included Bamboo Capital Partners, a Swiss-based impact investment firm, and KAAF Investments, a venture capital firm based in Kenya. Equator Capital Partners is excited to partner with Credable in its mission to provide affordable financial services to unbanked individuals in emerging markets. The investment firm believes that Credable's revenue-sharing model has the potential to disrupt the banking industry and create a more inclusive financial system. Bamboo Capital Partners also believes that Credable has the potential to make a significant impact in emerging markets. The firm is optimistic that the startup will use the funding to make a difference in the lives of millions of people who are currently excluded from banking services. KAAF Investments' investment in Credable reflects the firm's commitment to supporting innovative startups that seek to solve critical problems in emerging markets. The venture capital firm believes that Credable has the potential to transform the banking industry and create a more equitable economy. Overall, the seed funding round is a significant milestone for Credable and a step towards achieving its mission of empowering unbanked individuals in emerging markets. The startup hopes to scale its operations and create more partnerships in the future, enabling it to reach more customers and make a more significant impact in the banking industry.
