Musk: Robots to be Bigger Business than Tesla Cars. During a recent Tesla earnings call, Elon Musk made a shocking revelation that his upcoming robot plans have the potential to overtake the company's vehicle business. Musk, who referred to the project as Optimus, previewed a glimpse of the robot last year and it instantly became a viral internet sensation. The video showcased a human wearing a robot suit, dancing on stage, and amusing the audience. The humanoid robot, known as the Tesla Bot, is expected to utilize similar artificial intelligence (AI) systems used in Tesla vehicles. Although no working prototype has been developed yet, Musk provided some details about its capabilities. The Tesla Bot would possess a screen on its face and have the ability to lift weights of up to 150 pounds, while traveling at an estimated speed of 5 miles per hour. Initially, the robot will be employed at a Tesla plant, primarily for moving parts around the factory. However, Musk envisions a future where the Tesla Bot can address labor shortages across various industries. By integrating advanced AI technology, the robot could potentially revolutionize the way tasks are automated and performed, thus significantly impacting the job market. In a series of tweets, Musk also underscored how Tesla's AI advancements could contribute to the development of artificial general intelligence (AGI). AGI refers to highly autonomous systems that surpass human intelligence and possess a broad range of cognitive capabilities. Musk's ambitious vision for Tesla's AI, along with the arrival of Optimus, leads many experts to speculate on the company's future role in the AGI field. With the unexpected announcement, Musk has once again captured the attention of investors, enthusiasts, and analysts alike. While Tesla's electric vehicles have been the primary focus of the company, Musk's foray into the robotics industry highlights his determination to diversify Tesla's portfolio and push the boundaries of technology. As the world eagerly awaits the unveiling of the first Tesla Bot prototype, it remains to be seen how this revolutionary development will shape the future of automation and the role of robots in society.
