SmartWater: The Forensic Spray Helping Keep Women Safe. In a UK first, a man has been convicted and jailed for domestic abuse after being sprayed with SmartWater, a groundbreaking forensic liquid that can be traced back to its source using ultraviolet light. The technology, currently being trialled by police forces, aims to protect women from domestic violence by providing crucial evidence that can link perpetrators to specific incidents. The victim, based in West Yorkshire, is one of over 200 women across England who have been equipped with the forensic deterrent packages in their homes. These packages contain a hand-held canister, a gel for door handles and gates, as well as an automatic trap that releases the liquid when someone approaches the house. SmartWater remains on the skin for up to six weeks and can last even longer on clothing, enabling law enforcement to identify the perpetrator. Detective Superintendent Lee Berry of West Yorkshire Police, the brain behind this innovative idea, highlighted the challenge of prosecuting domestic abuse cases due to the difficulty of gathering evidence and the crimes typically occurring behind closed doors. SmartWater provides authorities with a means to track individuals back to specific locations, aiding in the identification of both perpetrator and victim. The technology is currently being utilized by West Yorkshire, South Yorkshire, and Staffordshire Police forces as part of their efforts to combat domestic violence. However, implementation comes at a cost, averaging around £150 per month per person. From a cost perspective, using forensic marking as a deterrent proves to be highly effective for law enforcement agencies. It typically costs around £640 to respond to a domestic abuse incident, while DS Berry estimates that utilizing SmartWater could save approximately £500 per deployment. The technology has garnered positive feedback from victims, with many expressing a heightened sense of safety. Over 94% of victims surveyed across the three police forces recommended SmartWater to others. Under the UK's Violence Against Women and Girls strategy, at least 20 out of the 43 police forces in England are sharing their approaches to tackle domestic abuse. DS Berry hopes that more police forces will adopt this technology in the future. SmartWater, previously used to protect property and deter thieves, is a liquid that becomes visible under ultraviolet lamps and torches used by the police, appearing as a fluorescent yellow glow. When applied to high-value items, it can be traced back to the original owner if stolen goods are recovered. The National Police Chiefs' Council attributed SmartWater to a 50% decrease in catalytic converter thefts, showcasing its effectiveness in combating crime. The application of SmartWater technology to combat domestic violence is a recent development. In the West Yorkshire case, the perpetrator was found guilty of harassing his ex-partner and breaching a non-molestation order. When the individual attempted to enter the victim's home, she swiftly sprayed the coded liquid from a canister, enabling the police to apprehend him and place him at the scene of the crime. Consequently, he was sentenced to 24 weeks in jail and handed a two-year restraining order. Rachael Oakley, the director of SmartWater's intelligence unit, emphasized the reliability of forensic markings compared to other deterrents, such as closed-circuit television (CCTV). Each bottle of SmartWater contains a unique combination of rare elements that can be traced back to a specific batch, providing solid evidence for investigations. The introduction of SmartWater technology in combatting domestic violence marks a significant step forward in protecting vulnerable individuals. With its potential to save both lives and resources, it is hoped that more police forces across the UK will embrace this innovative solution, ensuring the safety and well-being of those affected by domestic abuse.
