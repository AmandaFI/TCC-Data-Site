A 79-year-old motorcyclist who was left paralysed after a crash has taken his first steps with wearable robotic legs, which were originally developed for US soldiers. Harold Price, who was once an avid motorcyclist, had been paying £800 a month for private treatment after being denied help on the NHS due to his clinical status. However, thanks to the assistance of Ekso Bionics, a US robotics company, and some fundraising, he was finally able to take his first steps in more than two years. Harold was riding his motorbike in Abercarn, South Wales, when a car pulled out of a side road and knocked him off his bike. The crash caused serious spinal injuries, which left him in a wheelchair and unable to walk. Despite Harold's persistence and determination, he was turned down for any assistance from the NHS due to his clinical status. Rehabilitation experts have criticised the lack of funding for physiotherapy on the NHS, which has caused many patients to deteriorate physically and mentally. Speaking to The Guardian, Melanie Thomas, a consultant physiotherapist in palliative care, said: "It's really worrying to see the reduction in the number of people that are getting rehabilitation. It's a basic fundamental need that if you don't use your muscles and you don't move, they will waste away, and there are psychological implications as well.". However, in a recent announcement, the Welsh government has promised additional funding for community-based multi-professional rehabilitation support workers and more allied health professionals to provide rehabilitation services for patients like Harold. Harold's journey to walking again began with the GoFundMe page his daughter created in the hopes of raising enough money to buy the Ekso Bionics legs. The robotic legs wrap around the patient's upper thighs and lower legs, helping to lift them up and move them forward. Harold's daughter, Ruth, said: "We felt really helpless and frustrated because we couldn't get Harold the help he deserved. The Ekso Bionics legs seemed to be the only light at the end of the tunnel.". After raising the necessary funds, Harold travelled to London for his first trial of the Ekso Bionics legs, which was designed to measure his ability to stand and transfer his weight. The trial went well, and it was decided that Harold would be fitted with his own pair of wearable robotic legs. The Ekso Bionics legs cost around £125,000 and are not currently available on the NHS. However, Harold's progress has been remarkable, and he has taken his first steps with the help of his new legs. Speaking to The Guardian, Harold said: "It was like a miracle – it was as if I was walking again for the first time. It's incredible to have that sensation back.". Harold's physiotherapist, Sally Cuffin, said: "He's still got a lot of work to go, but he's got his glutes, his thigh muscles and his calf muscles back. It's just that motor pattern of being able to use them without anything else helping him.". At 79 years old, Harold is one of the oldest patients to use the Ekso Bionics legs, but his progress serves as a beacon of hope for others who may have given up on ever walking again. Harold said, "I want to show people that there is still life in you and ways of moving forward.". The Welsh government's additional funding for community-based multi-professional rehabilitation support workers and more allied health professionals to provide rehabilitation services will be welcomed by rehabilitation experts like Melanie Thomas and patients like Harold, who have been unable to access the help they need from the NHS. The Welsh government's health minister, Vaughan Gething, said: "We are committed to supporting people to live as independently as they can, for as long as possible. This funding shows our commitment to creating opportunities for people to receive regular, effective rehabilitation support in their communities, helping them to recover more quickly and enjoy a better quality of life.". Harold's story is one of resilience and determination, and it serves as a reminder that, with the right resources and support, people can overcome extraordinary challenges.
