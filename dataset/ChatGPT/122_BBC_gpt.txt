Twitch: Kai Cenat banned from streaming platform. One of Twitch's biggest names in livestreaming, Kai Cenat, has been banned from the platform due to a violation of Twitch's terms of service, it was announced on Tuesday. Cenat, who previously held the record for having the most subscriptions to his channel, with more than 300,000 at its peak, came to prominence when he broke the subscription records previously set by Ludwig and Ninja in March. Twitch users can follow their favourite streamers and creators for free or support them by subscribing or gifting subscriptions to other viewers. Jynxzi, 21, now holds the record for the most subscriptions, currently at 75,000, and more than a million followers. While Twitch has not commented on the matter, the ban has caused uproar among Cenat's fans and fellow streamers. Cenat, who is a popular variety streamer and known for playing games such as Fortnite and Apex Legends, has not yet commented on the ban but his friend and fellow streamer, Shai_Will, said on Twitter: "Kai's been banned. Don't ask me why, I don't know.". This is not the first time Twitch has banned a popular streamer for violating its terms of service. In 2018, Tyler "Ninja" Blevins was banned for using racist language during a stream, and in 2019, Guy "Dr Disrespect" Beahm was banned for broadcasting from a bathroom during a live stream. Cenat's ban follows several months of controversy on Twitch over the platform's handling of sexual harassment allegations against streamers. In June, several prominent streamers were accused of sexual misconduct, leading Twitch to launch an investigation and make changes to its policies. Twitch's decision to ban Cenat will likely be met with mixed reactions, as his fans have been quick to defend him on social media, while others have called for stricter enforcement of Twitch's rules.
