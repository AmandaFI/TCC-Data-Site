Heineken made waves in the virtual world recently with the launch of its very own virtual beer. The Dutch brewer organized a virtual event in Decentraland, a user-owned virtual world, to promote its unique creation. The virtual beer, which Heineken described as a satirical "joke," aimed to draw attention to the growing trend of businesses exploring the metaverse. The metaverse, a concept where individuals spend their time in interconnected virtual worlds accessed through virtual reality (VR) headsets, has gained significant attention in recent months. Facebook's rebranding to Meta in October 2021 and CEO Mark Zuckerberg's vision of interconnected virtual worlds for work and play have contributed to the growing excitement surrounding this concept. Heineken's virtual launch took place in a virtual brewery, adding to the surreal nature of the experience. Attendees were greeted with descriptions of the "product" that included humorously brewed beer made with "binary-coded hops grown by NPC farmers" (non-player characters). The event included interactive elements, such as a tasting card, which added to the overall immersive feeling. Bram Westenbrink, Heineken's global head of brand, explained that while the metaverse does bring people together in an enjoyable way, it is not the ideal setting for tasting a new beer. He emphasized that the virtual beer was a self-aware idea intended to satirize brands venturing into the metaverse with products that are best experienced in the real world. The event attracted media attention, with Tom Ffiske, editor of Immersive Wire, attending the virtual launch. Ffiske described the experience as surreal, with many attendees left confused about the purpose of the event. He noted the interactive elements, such as the tasting card, which added to the perplexing nature of the experience. Ffiske ultimately concluded that the bizarre nature of the event seemed intentional, based on the ending speech. Heineken's virtual beer launch is part of a larger trend of brands investing in virtual worlds and virtual goods. In December, Nike acquired virtual shoe company RTFKT, aiming to serve athletes and creators at the intersection of sport, creativity, gaming, and culture. Investment bank JP Morgan Chase also opened a virtual lounge in Decentraland, expressing its belief that the metaverse will eventually become a trillion-dollar industry. Heineken's approach to the metaverse highlights the potential for creativity, humor, and self-mockery in this emerging space. While some businesses are venturing into the metaverse with the aim of replicating real-world experiences, Heineken's virtual beer serves as a reminder that some things are simply best experienced in the real world. As the metaverse continues to evolve, it will be interesting to see how other brands navigate this virtual frontier and engage with consumers in innovative ways.
