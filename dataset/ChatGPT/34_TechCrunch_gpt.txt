Social media users who put a premium on getting verified might have to adjust their expectations. Twitter and Instagram recently updated their verification rules, which makes it harder to get the coveted blue checkmark. With the new rules, even public figures and media outlets might not be entitled to verified status. Some previously verified users have lost their status, and the verification process has become more difficult. The TechCrunch Podcast acknowledged the changing landscape, discussing the subject with their new reporter, Morgan Sung. In addition to the change in verification rules, TechCrunch also offered a promo code for discounted founder and investor passes to their upcoming Early Stage conference in Boston. The conference provides a unique opportunity for early-stage startup founders and investors to build relationships, learn strategies, and make valuable connections. For social media users, it's worth watching how verification rules continue to shape the social media landscape.
