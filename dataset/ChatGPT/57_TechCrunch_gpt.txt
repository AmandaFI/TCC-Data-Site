Ukrainian mobile-first startup, Zeely, has secured $1m in seed funding to expand its AI-driven growth app for small- to medium-sized businesses (SMBs) in the UK, US, Brazil, and Mexico. The mobile app offers an affordable solution for SMBs to create a web store, bookkeeping and financial reports and market themselves on social media with customer-oriented statistics, bolstering their online presence and elevating their branding. The platform prides itself on allowing even the most technologically-challenged business owners a chance to up their marketing game. A spokesperson for the company confirmed that the seed funds will be used for payment systems integration and development to expand their AI capabilities, a move that is expected to revamp the way SMBs capitalize on their online advertising. The ultimate goal is to reach an estimated annual growth rate of $3m by the end of the year. Analysts say the startup provides a much-needed solution for small business owners in emerging markets like Latin America, where the majority of firms belong to the SMB classification. Most struggle to afford the costs of securing professional marketing services and are often ill-equipped with the technical know-how to create decent branding and an engaging online presence. Zeely's app levels the playing field by providing a platform that can be accessed by all, making online marketing accessible. The startup gained attention last year during the Slush controversy which saw another Ukrainian start-up accused of fraud. Zeely, however, was quick to make it known that it had no affiliation with the other company and set out to clear its name. Since then, the company has worked diligently to develop its platform, adding exciting new features and expanding its reach. The recent seed round funding has been described as a significant step towards achieving the company's vision of helping SMBs thrive. Zeely's CEO, Vinny Lohan, said, â€œWe are excited about the response we have received thus far, and we intend to use the funding to enhance our platform's capabilities. Our focus is to make our services available to small businesses around the world, not only to those who have a hefty marketing budget. We believe that every business deserves a fair chance to succeed." He went on to add that while international expansion was important, catering to Latin American SMBs was a priority, as the region presented unique opportunities for growth. Additionally, he noted that it was imperative to have affordable pricing plans for both developed and developing markets, as SMBs often operate on a limited budget. The app, which is still in beta version, has received glowing feedback from early adopters who believe that it has potential to revolutionize SMB advertising. "The app is intuitive and easy to use, it's like having a marketing team in your pocket," remarks Ed Summers, a small business owner in London. With its automated features and customer-oriented statistics, the start-up hopes to create bespoke plans for business owners, making it easier to achieve their marketing goals while cutting on costs. Zeely's app is available on both Android and iOS via the app store. . Zeely's focus on payment systems integration is also regarded as a smart move as more customers opt for contactless payments and cash is no longer the primary mode of payment for most transactions. By making it easier for businesses to process transactions via different payment methods, the app will enable SMBs to reach out to more potential customers while at the same time making payments and accounting operations more straightforward.  . Zeely is one of the few mobile-first startups in the emerging market space that has caught the attention of early stage investors. The shift to mobile-first approaches is seen as a way to improve scalability, cost control, productivity, and efficiency for SMBs with limited budgets. Experts predict that companies like Zeely will play a vital role in supporting SMBs by offering scalable, affordable, and easy to implement digital solutions designed to help these businesses grow.
