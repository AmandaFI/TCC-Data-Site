Artificial intelligence (AI) has become big business, with investment in the technology reaching $94bn in 2021, according to data from Stanford University. This is double the amount of investment made last year, as experts and investors alike, try to tap into the potential of artificial intelligence. OpenAI CEO, Sam Altman, believes that someone will build a software system that is "smarter and more capable than humans in every way". However, the high cost of developing such software means that companies need to hype AI technologies to attract investment. Unfortunately, while there has been a lot of hype, actual implementations have been slower to materialise, and finding talent to fill AI roles has become increasingly difficult. Despite the challenges, investment in AI is growing. Companies are looking to replace human labour in a range of sectors, including healthcare, marketing and sales, to name a few. However, the technology is expensive and companies are struggling to generate sufficient returns on their investment to justify the cost. One potential solution to this dilemma is the development of AI models that can help to pay for themselves. Researchers at Stanford University are already working on ways to reduce the cost of developing AI models, by using machine learning to automate the process. The team has developed a system called "Auto-Tune", which is designed to optimise machine learning algorithms by automatically adjusting the settings in real-time as data is fed into the system. This means that the AI system can learn and adapt on the fly, without requiring constant supervision from human operators. Auto-Tune is capable of generating high accuracy AI models with a very low error rate, which is crucial for applications such as healthcare, where even small errors can have serious consequences. The system is also highly scalable, meaning that it can be used to build complex models that can handle vast amounts of data. "We believe that Auto-Tune has the potential to transform the way that AI is developed and implemented" said Prof. Andrew Ng, who is leading the research team at Stanford. "By reducing the cost and complexity of developing AI models, we can make the technology more accessible to a wider range of organisations, and help to drive down the cost of implementation.". Auto-Tune is not the only system that is seeking to reduce the costs of AI development. IBM Watson Studio, which was launched in 2017, is another platform that aims to help companies to build and deploy AI and machine learning models more easily. Watson Studio offers a range of tools and services that are designed to simplify the process of developing and deploying AI systems. Despite the challenges facing the AI industry, there is little doubt that the technology has the potential to transform a wide range of industries and create significant value for investors. However, to achieve this, companies must find ways to generate returns on their investment. The development of AI models that can help to pay for themselves could be a game-changer for the industry. By reducing the cost and complexity of development, companies will be able to deploy AI systems more quickly and efficiently, and generate greater returns on their investment. However, this will require a significant investment in research and development, and companies must be prepared to take risks and invest in the future. With the right support, AI has the potential to transform the world we live in, and create a brighter and more prosperous future for all.
