On April 26, edtech entrepreneur Sam Chaudhary will be sharing his thoughts on TechCrunch Live about the opportunities in the long-game of his industry. Chaudhary is the founder of ClassDojo, a consumer app that aims to be the go-to brand for child education. Although he raised over $200 million in venture capital from Silicon Valley investors, he took eight years to introduce a formal revenue model into his company. Chaudhary will be sharing his journey and lessons learned with the show's hosts and viewers. Chaudhary's appearance on TechCrunch Live comes at a time when the edtech industry is booming due to the COVID-19 pandemic. With many students forced to learn from home, teachers have turned to edtech tools to improve their students' educational experiences. This gives companies like ClassDojo an opportunity to shine and make an impact on the educational landscape. Chaudhary will be discussing these opportunities and the post-pandemic world for edtech. ClassDojo is known for its unique approach to education that focuses on creating positive classroom cultures. The app allows teachers to track their students' progress and communicate with parents in real-time. This approach has earned ClassDojo a loyal following of over 55 million users worldwide. With Chaudhary's leadership, the company is poised to continue growing and evolving as a leader in the education industry. Chaudhary will not be alone on the show, as he will be joined by his investor, Chris Farmer, the founder and CEO of SignalFire. Farmer will talk about his investment strategy when it comes to companies that aren't rushing to monetize. The two will share insights into their journey together and provide advice to startups seeking funding in the edtech space. TechCrunch Live is offering a free opportunity for participants to register for Pitch Practice. This provides startups with the chance to pitch their ideas to Chaudhary and Farmer and receive feedback on their business plans. With Chaudhary's success in building ClassDojo, entrepreneurs in the edtech space can learn a wealth of information from him and his investor. Overall, Chaudhary's appearance on TechCrunch Live will provide valuable insights into the world of edtech and the exciting opportunities available to entrepreneurs in this field.
