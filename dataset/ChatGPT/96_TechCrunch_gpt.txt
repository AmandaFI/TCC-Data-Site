The proposed new restrictions around AI models in China have caused concern among those in the industry who fear it will have a chilling effect on the nascent sector. The country's regulators have put forward rules that require user identification and security reviews, and prohibit "any content that subverts state power, advocates the overthrow of the socialist system, incites splitting the country or undermines national unity.". This comes after Chinese tech companies have rolled out their versions of general purpose large language models, versatile AI systems that can converse in natural language and carry out a surprising number of tasks. However, these new rules will prohibit generative AI that subverts government power and authority or questions national unity, as well as various other categories of prohibitions like ethnic discrimination and terrorism. The restrictions would also require providers to assume liability and responsibility for the training data of models, including difficult to measure metrics like authenticity, objectivity, and diversity. Furthermore, users of the services must be verified as real people, while personal information and reputation must be respected or regulators may find the provider liable. Generated content must also be labeled as such, among other restrictions. While some of these requirements could be considered prudent or critical to a responsible AI industry, many would be incredibly difficult, perhaps impossible to implement by today's companies and R&D efforts. Yu Kai, founder of Chinese AI company Horizon Robotics, said: "We have been working on AI technology for several years, but we have always respected relevant laws and regulations. It's hard to say how the new rules will affect our business, because we still have to wait for the final version to be published.". Another industry insider, Zhang Jia, CEO of AI start-up Collective Wisdom Technology, said, "The proposed regulations are too strict and demanding for gen-AI startup companies. As a startup company, it's already difficult enough to get access to high-quality data and get the capital needed for operation. With further regulatory restrictions, the AI industry in China might be hampered in its development.". The implications of these restrictions are potentially far-reaching, given that artificial intelligence is already an important driver of China's economy. AI and related industries, including autonomous vehicles, are expected to be worth billions of dollars in China in the coming years, as the country aims to dominate key sectors of the global economy with its Made in China 2025 and China Standards 2035 initiatives. The move also puts China in a different position from other countries around the world, where AI regulation has focused much more on protecting individuals' privacy and data. In Europe, for example, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) sets strict rules on how companies collect, process and store individuals' data. In the US, the Federal Trade Commission has focused on regulating the use of AI and machine learning to protect against bias, discrimination, and privacy violations. Some industry experts suggest that the new rules could simply be a signal from China's regulators that they are willing to crack down on any perceived threats to the country's social and political stability. Others argue that the rules provide an advantage to Chinese tech companies over their US counterparts, where there is more concern around the ethical use of AI and its potential to amplify existing biases in society. Regardless of the reasons behind the proposed regulations, there are concerns about their practical implications on Chinese AI research and development. It remains to be seen whether the regulations will stifle innovation or whether they will have the desired effect of protecting social stability in China.
