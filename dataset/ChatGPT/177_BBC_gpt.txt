Wiltshire Police 'Digi-dogs' Trained to Sniff Out Technology. Wiltshire Police has introduced two specially trained springer spaniels, dubbed 'Digi-dogs', to help in the investigation of cyber-related crimes. The two dogs, Dora and Bonny, are members of the force's Digital Investigations and Intelligence Unit (DIIU) and have been trained to detect USB sticks, hard drives, and mobile phone SIM cards. Sam Dutton, one of the dog handlers, stressed the significance of digital evidence in criminal investigations. He highlighted the crucial role it plays in cases involving drug offenses, where it is vital to identify individuals' contacts and mobile phones. The addition of the Digi-dogs to the DIIU will greatly enhance the force's capabilities in tackling technology-driven crimes. The DIIU was established in 2018 to provide support to frontline staff and officers within Wiltshire Police in cases involving a digital or technological component. Since its inception, the team has worked closely with the Major Crime Investigation Team (MCIT) on several high-profile cases, including the murder investigation of Ellie Gould. In this particular case, the DIIU examined phone usage as part of the broader investigation. The introduction of Dora and Bonny to the DIIU marks a significant step forward in the force's ability to combat cybercrimes. These specially trained dogs possess a heightened sense of smell, enabling them to sniff out hidden technology even in concealed locations. Their capabilities will prove invaluable in locating crucial evidence that could otherwise be easily overlooked. Detective Chief Inspector Joe Saunders, who leads the DIIU, expressed his excitement about the new additions to the team. He stated, "Dora and Bonny have already proved their worth during their training, and we are confident that they will greatly enhance our ability to solve cyber-related crimes.". The DIIU's focus on digital investigations demonstrates the ever-evolving nature of policing, where the use of technology is increasing in both the perpetration of crimes and the gathering of evidence. With the assistance of Dora and Bonny, Wiltshire Police is well-positioned to remain at the forefront of combating cyber-related offenses and ensuring that justice is served.
