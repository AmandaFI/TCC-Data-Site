ZEBOX, the international accelerator network focused on technology innovation in the supply chain industry, has launched its Asia Pacific headquarters in Singapore. ZEBOX Asia will be backed by Singapore's Maritime and Port Authority and Enterprise Singapore, alongside industry partners Bureau Veritas, PSA unboXed, and Synergy Marine Group. With hubs in five other locations, ZEBOX helps start-ups with funding, mentoring, expert advice, and testing opportunities. ZEBOX Asia will focus on markets including Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, and Taiwan. "By setting up ZEBOX Asia in Singapore, supply chain start-ups in the region will now have the opportunity to work closely with global industry leaders and tap into Singapore's vibrant start-up ecosystem," said Tan Beng Tee, Assistant Chief Executive, Development Group, Enterprise Singapore. The launch event, held virtually due to the Covid-19 pandemic, saw a keynote address from Rodolphe Saadé, founder of ZEBOX and CEO of CMA CGM Group, a leading freight forwarding company. "In Asia, we are seeing tremendous interest in mingling tech and the supply chain," he said. "Singapore has become a go-to hub for advances in this field." . With ZEBOX expanding into the Asia Pacific region, Saadé said he was optimistic about the future of start-ups in the region. "Asia will be the continent of the 21st century," he said. "It will lead the world in technology and innovation. The creation of ZEBOX Asia in Singapore is designed to consolidate our presence in the region and accelerate the growth of start-ups we need.". ZEBOX looks for start-ups in four areas, including operational efficiency, decarbonisation, workflow automation, and the future of work. Collaborating with partners, ZEBOX offers start-ups access to expert advice, mentorship, and testing opportunities. Corporate clients working with start-ups are open to addressing specific business challenges. The maritime sector is a significant industry in Singapore, with about 100,000 people working in the industry and contributing around 7% to Singapore's Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The launch of ZEBOX Asia has been seen as a significant boost for the country's maritime and logistics industry, as it helps to bring innovative ideas and solutions to an industry that is in the midst of significant transformation. "The maritime sector is a significant contributor to Singapore's economy," said Chee Hong Tat, Senior Minister of State, Ministry of Transport and Ministry of Foreign Affairs. "Singapore will continue to play our role in facilitating business collaborations and marketplace opportunities between global and local players and help our local companies grow and internationalize.". The support of the Maritime and Port Authority and Enterprise Singapore, coupled with the involvement of industry partners Bureau Veritas, PSA unboXed, and Synergy Marine Group, ensures that ZEBOX Asia will be able to provide expert guidance and help start-ups to succeed in their ventures. For example, PSA unboXed, a corporate innovation program by PSA International, brings expertise in supply chain, logistics and trade facilitation to ZEBOX Asia. "We believe that ZEBOX Asia will enable us to continue to foster our innovation efforts with the addition of more start-ups into the ecosystem," said Oh Bee Lock, Head of PSA unboXed. Similarly, Bureau Veritas, a global leader in testing, inspection, and certification services, offers technical support, quality assurance, testing, and consumer safety services to ZEBOX Asia's start-ups. "ZEBOX Asia, supported by Bureau Veritas, will provide start-ups with the right tools to innovate and implement the next big ideas for the supply chain industry," said Antonio Astone, Vice President, South APAC, Government Services and International Trade Division, Bureau Veritas. The launch of ZEBOX Asia in Singapore has been seen as a significant step in the country's efforts to become a leading maritime and logistics hub in the region. The government has been actively supporting such efforts, with initiatives such as the Maritime Industry Transformation Map, aimed at transforming the sector through digitalization and talent development. . "The maritime sector is going through a major disruption, with the advent of new technologies such as blockchain, IoT, and AI," said Tan Beng Tee, Assistant Chief Executive, Development Group, Enterprise Singapore. "This is why it is so important that we continue to foster partnerships that bridge the gap between the traditional maritime players and the emerging technology innovators.".
