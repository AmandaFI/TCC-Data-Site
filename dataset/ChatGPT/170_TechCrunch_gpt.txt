Twitter, the popular social media platform, is making a major change to its advertising policy, requiring all advertisers to have a verified checkmark. Starting from Wednesday 21 April, those without the verification will need to subscribe to Twitter Blue or Verified Organizations to continue running ads on the platform. This change will impact both personal and business accounts. Twitter's decision to require a verified checkmark from its advertisers is a part of its broader verification strategy and ongoing efforts to reduce fraudulent accounts and bots. Verified checkmarks are important for establishing transparency and authenticity on the platform, and Twitter has been working hard to ensure that its verification process is fair and effective. This change may be surprising to some businesses, who may have been relying on Twitter ads to reach their target audience. However, those accounts with verified checkmarks or business accounts spending over $1,000 per month on ads already have access to advertising without interruption. While some may see this move as a way for Twitter to push its subscription-based model, it is important to note that the platform still heavily relies on advertising dollars. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey has been vocal about the importance of both models, stating that the subscription-based Twitter Blue is complementary to the advertising-based model. Many companies have already been embracing Twitter advertising, seeing it as an effective way to reach their target demographic. With this new policy, however, they may need to re-evaluate their advertising strategies. This change may also impact those looking to advertise on behalf of political campaigns. In recent years, there has been a growing concern about the role social media in spreading misinformation during political campaigns. Twitter's new ad policy may help to address these concerns by ensuring that political advertisements come from verified sources. While this change may be seen as a disruption to the current advertising ecosystem on Twitter, it is important to note that the platform is constantly evolving. This change aligns with Twitter's broader goals of providing a transparent, authentic, and safe platform for users. As Twitter continues to prioritize its verification strategy and work to reduce the number of fraudulent accounts and bots on its platform, it is likely that we will see more changes to its advertising policy in the future. For now, however, advertisers will need to adapt to this new requirement to ensure that their ads reach their target audience on Twitter.
