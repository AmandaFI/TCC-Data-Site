Netflix Halts Projects in Russia Amidst Ongoing Ukraine Invasion. Streaming giant Netflix has announced that it will be putting a pause on all future projects and acquisitions in Russia due to the ongoing invasion of Ukraine. The company is currently evaluating the impact of the situation before moving forward with any new endeavors. As a result, the production of the Russian language series, Zato, will be suspended for the time being. Oracle, a leading cloud computing company, has also followed suit by suspending its operations in Russia. This decision comes after a series of escalating attacks on Ukrainian cities. The actions taken by Netflix and Oracle mirror those of other US technology firms, which are taking steps against Russia amidst the Ukrainian crisis. In addition to this, tech giant Apple announced on Tuesday that it will halt sales in Russia as well. Oracle's decision to suspend operations came shortly after Ukraine's Minister of Digital Transformation made a public request to the company for its support via Twitter. These recent developments highlight the growing tensions between Russia and Ukraine and demonstrate the significant impact it is having on the tech industry.
