Apple, Nike, and Google have joined a growing list of brands that are limiting their services in response to the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Apple made a significant move by announcing that it would halt all product sales in Russia. The tech giant expressed concern over the Russian invasion and stated its solidarity with those suffering due to the violence. In addition to stopping product sales, Apple has also limited services such as Apple Pay and Apple Maps. This move is seen as a safety measure for Ukrainian citizens, as Apple has disabled traffic and live incidents in Apple Maps in Ukraine. Ukrainian Vice Prime Minister Mykhailo Fedorov publicly called on Apple to cut Russia off from its products, services, and App Store, and the tech giant's decision to limit services in the region is a step in that direction. Nike, another major company, has also taken action by stopping online orders in Russia. The company cited the inability to guarantee the delivery of goods to customers as the reason for halting online orders. However, customers were directed to their nearest Nike stores, ensuring they still have access to the brand's products. Nike's decision was praised by a Ukrainian member of parliament as an example of private companies imposing sanctions against Russia. Several other high-profile brands have also pulled back from Russia in response to the conflict. This includes film studios, carmakers, and technology firms. Google has also made its stance clear by removing Russian state-funded publishers from its features. Additionally, mobile banking apps in Russian may soon not function fully on devices using Apple's iOS operating system. The combined efforts of these companies limit Russia's access to services and products, making a statement against the country's actions in Ukraine. As the conflict continues, it is likely that more brands will take similar measures to limit their involvement with Russia. The actions of Apple, Nike, and Google are seen as a significant contribution to the pressure being applied on the Russian government from both private and government entities.
