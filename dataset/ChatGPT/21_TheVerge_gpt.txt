Microsoft inks another deal to capture and store its carbon emissions underground. Microsoft has taken another step towards its goal of becoming carbon negative by 2030 and removing the equivalent of all its historical emissions by 2050. The tech giant recently announced that it has entered into an agreement with Los Angeles-based startup CarbonCapture to purchase carbon removal credits from the company's modular, direct air capture (DAC) plant called Project Bison in Wyoming. This announcement came after Microsoft recently pledged to reduce its carbon emissions to zero by 2030. CarbonCapture's Project Bison is due to start operating in 2024 and will draw CO2 from the atmosphere for underground storage. CarbonCapture expects to capture and store 10,000 metric tons of CO2 annually after deploying its first modules in Wyoming next year, with support from Dallas-based Frontier Carbon Solutions. Microsoft is determined to lead the charge towards a carbon-free future by leveraging the technology and investments necessary to accelerate the transition to a low-carbon economy. The company recognizes that it cannot simply reduce its carbon footprint to zero through the purchase of renewable energy and other measures like increasing energy efficiency. Therefore, it is investing in innovative carbon removal solutions like CarbonCapture's Project Bison, which are essential for achieving net-zero carbon emissions. This deal is the latest in a series of partnerships Microsoft has made in recent years to find ways of removing more carbon from the atmosphere than it emits. The tech giant has been investing in carbon capture and storage projects around the world and has set up a $1 billion climate innovation fund to support research into new clean technologies. The project is expected to have many spin-off benefits, including creating jobs and revenue streams for local communities. CarbonCapture has partnered with the University of Wyoming School of Energy Resources and Carbon Management Institute to build a workforce development programme that will provide training for people interested in the new industry. In addition to this latest partnership, Microsoft has also announced a partnership with NOVOMER to develop a carbon capture and conversion technology that will allow emissions from industrial processes to be turned into usable chemicals. While Microsoft's ambitious carbon-negative goals are an impressive undertaking, the company admits that carbon removal technology does not yet exist at the scale needed to achieve these goals. Direct air capture using devices like Project Bison is one promising solution, but it will take time and sustained investment to scale up. The cost of carbon capture and storage remains high, but Microsoft's investment and leadership in the field could help bring these costs down and pave the way for carbon-neutral industries in the future. It is clear that in order to meet the ever-increasing demands of a carbon-conscious world, companies must take the lead in developing sustainable solutions to tackle the global climate crisis. Microsoft's commitment to sustainable energy and carbon removal is part of a larger trend among companies seeking to reduce their impact on the environment and lead the transition to a more sustainable economy. The tech giant's recent announcement shows that it is willing to invest heavily in new technologies and new partnerships to achieve its carbon-negative goals, and that it is serious about confronting one of the most pressing issues facing humanity.
