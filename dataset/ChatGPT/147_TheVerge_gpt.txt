Messaging apps like WhatsApp urge UK to rethink ‘flawed’ legislation. Leading instant messaging services have banded together to urge the UK government to rethink its plans to roll out new online safety legislation. Seven companies including WhatsApp, Signal, Threema, Element, Wire, Session and Viber have written an open letter to the government warning that its proposed Online Safety Bill could be “flawed” and risked undermining end-to-end encryption. The letter highlights concerns amongst technology companies that the UK government plans to empower OFCOM to force proactive scanning of private messages on end-to-end encrypted communication services, a move that could significantly compromise encryption and user privacy. The proposed legislation aims to better protect UK citizens from harm online, particularly children who frequently use social media platforms. Social media companies would be made accountable for user safety, but critics say the bill could lead to abuse of power, with social media companies overly moderated and hamstrung by the new legislation. Of particular concern is government pressure to undermine the very protection that makes online messaging apps secure in the first place. Both WhatsApp and Signal have previously warned that they may cease operations in the UK if the bill is passed in its current form. End-to-end encryption, which is employed by both WhatsApp and Signal, is the strongest available form of encryption for messaging services, with private messages secured using unique and complex cryptographic keys. As it stands, the new legislation would likely require social media companies to undermine encryption protocol, leaving messages open to third-party interference, and users' private information vulnerable to cyber attack. In their open letter, the messaging services wrote: “We believe that creating a backdoor into encrypted communications… would be a grave security risk... We urge the UK government to recognise the need to continue to maintain strong encryption, which is essential to ensuring cybersecurity and fundamental human rights, including privacy and freedom of expression.”. The message is clear - if the UK government passes the bill in its current state, messaging apps could become compromised and consumer trust in the UK tech industry could be severely damaged, leading to significant financial impact for UK tech companies. In addition to the open letter from messaging companies, the Joint Committee on Human Rights in the UK has also expressed concern about the proposed legislation and called for additional safeguards to ensure users’ privacy is not compromised when the bill finally becomes law. Despite the growing concern from technology experts and human rights activists, the UK government has disputed the messaging companies’ claims. Officials have denied that the proposed legislation would require social media companies to compromise encryption protocols or interfere with the privacy of users. However, the broad language of the bill has raised alarm with privacy advocates, leaving many to call for changes to be made before the bill is passed into law. As the UK government races to bring its Online Safety Bill into force, the tech community is increasingly vocal in its concerns, and with highly prominent messaging apps such as WhatsApp and Signal warning they will not compromise their encryption standards, the UK government risks being seen as overreaching and damaging the UK tech sector. It remains to be seen whether enough pressure can be brought to bear on the government to bring about the necessary changes required to satisfy all parties’ demands and ensure a balanced approach to user protection and privacy.
