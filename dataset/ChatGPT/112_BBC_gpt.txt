Grimes has shaken up the music industry by offering her voice for use in artificial intelligence-generated songs. The pop singer and producer is inviting musicians to clone her voice using AI, and she has said that she will split 50% of the royalties for any successful AI-generated song that uses her voice. Grimes maintains that this offer is the same as that for any traditional collaboration, and has stated that she is "energised by the idea of open-sourcing all art and killing copyright". The announcement came amid concerns about the use of AI in music production. Recently, Universal Music removed a song from circulation after it was revealed to feature deep-faked vocals from artists Drake and The Weeknd. The industry backlash against such music has been significant, with some questioning whether the use of AI-generated songs constitutes art at all. Grimes has sought to assuage such concerns, however, by emphasizing the creative potential of AI. "AI-generated music has limitless creativity and potential," she tweeted. "The idea of having an army of likeminded AI-artists collaborating and sharing with one another is a beautiful thought. It's always been my dream to be able to write music without technical limitations. Perhaps AI is the answer.". The move by Grimes marks a significant departure from traditional music-making practices, where the focus has typically been on protecting copyrights and intellectual property. The pop star's willingness to open the door to collaboration with AI-generated music is a sign that there is perhaps a receptive audience for such creative expressions. There are, however, concerns about the quality and authenticity of AI-generated music. Critics have argued that such songs lack the emotional resonance of those created by human performers, and that their production constitutes a form of plagiarism. Despite these concerns, the popularity of AI-generated music appears to be on the rise. In recent years, a number of artists have experimentally incorporated elements of AI into their music, with varying degrees of success. Some have even gone so far as to train AI programs to generate entire songs, using data from their own musical output in the learning process. Grimes's offer to share her voice with musicians using AI-generated music is a significant development in this trend, which could pave the way for further experimentation and collaboration in the field. Whether or not such experiments will ultimately lead to the creation of truly original and innovative music remains to be seen, but for now it seems that the possibilities presented by AI are too tempting for many artists to ignore.
