CES 2022: Colour Changing Cars and Remotes that Eat Wi-Fi. Las Vegas - The annual Consumer Electronics Show (CES) took place in Las Vegas this week, showcasing a wide range of innovative and futuristic technologies. Despite lower attendance and the absence of major firms like Meta, Google, and Amazon due to concerns over the Omicron variant, there were still plenty of interesting and outlandish gadgets on display. One standout innovation came from Samsung, who introduced a new TV remote control with a unique feature. Last year, the company added a solar panel to the remote for charging. This year, they took it a step further by adding a tiny antenna that can harvest radio frequency signals emitted by Wi-Fi routers, allowing the remote to charge even without sunlight. Samsung plans to include this new remote with its new TVs and other home appliances, providing users with a convenient and sustainable charging solution. In the automotive sector, BMW showcased a concept car with "iX Flow" technology that can change the car's exterior color or pattern with a small electric current. This innovative feature has the potential to reduce the need for cooling or heating inside the vehicle, depending on the chosen color. However, critics have noted that the system appears to be temperature-sensitive, and they have raised concerns about the limited color options available. In terms of robotics, CES 2022 saw a shift towards more practical and useful robots, rather than human-like ones. Bear Robotics presented the Servi one, a robot designed to serve food and replace human waiters. This development could revolutionize the hospitality industry and improve efficiency in restaurants and cafes. Labrador Systems also showcased their Retriever bot, which is designed to assist people with mobility issues. The robot can navigate a home using sensors and can be controlled through voice commands or a smartphone app. The aim is to put the Retriever bot into production in 2023, offering a valuable solution to individuals with mobility challenges. The beauty industry also made its mark at CES 2022. Icon.AI won an innovation award for its Sound Mirror, which combines a conventional mirror with a voice-activated smart speaker. This integration allows users to enjoy their favorite music or podcasts while getting ready in front of the mirror. L'Oreal unveiled an at-home hair dye device, providing consumers with an easy and convenient way to color their hair without visiting a salon. Ninu introduced a smart perfume bottle that can create personalized fragrances through a smartphone app, offering a unique and customized experience for perfume enthusiasts. Additionally, the Y-Brush, a unique electric toothbrush that claims to brush teeth in just 10 seconds, made a return to CES with an improved design, promising a more efficient and time-saving oral care routine. Due to the ongoing pandemic, some companies opted for virtual presentations or a combination of physical and digital experiences. Samsung offered a "metaverse booth," where users could experience their products while decorating their virtual home. Procter and Gamble partnered with London's Royal Botanic Gardens to create a "metaverse" experience, allowing users to explore virtual grounds and learn about sustainability initiatives. SK Group presented a 360-degree video presentation in their Green Forest Pavilion, merging the physical and digital realms to emphasize global carbon reduction plans. Overall, CES 2022 showcased a variety of innovative and futuristic technologies, despite the challenges posed by the pandemic. The event highlighted the resilience and creativity of the consumer electronics industry, as companies continue to push the boundaries and introduce new and exciting products. From color-changing cars to remote controls that can charge without sunlight, CES 2022 proved to be a platform for innovation and a glimpse into the future of technology.
