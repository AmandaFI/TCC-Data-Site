Enter, a Germany-based home energy assessment startup, has secured â‚¬19.4m ($22.7m) in a series A investment round led by Target Global. The company provides homeowners with a digital survey and assessment of their buildings' energy consumption and offers suggestions and financing advice for energy-saving renovations. It also manages relevant subsidy applications, providing an end-to-end service for customers. According to Justus Menten, Enter's co-founder and managing director, traditional energy assessments are too slow for today's climate goals. "To achieve our climate goals, it must be more than one million properties upgraded. Today's certified energy efficiency consultants cannot achieve this goal in the traditional way," he said. Enter aims to solve this issue by using digital tools and technology to provide quicker and more accessible home energy assessments. The company's platform combines information from user inputs and sensor data to provide an accurate picture of each building's energy consumption. It then offers personalised recommendations for energy-saving renovations and manages all related applications for funding and subsidies. "We want to be a trusted partner for homeowners, providing reliable information and support through every step of the process," said Menten. "Our goal is to make energy efficiency improvements accessible to everyone, regardless of their financial situation.". Enter plans to use the funds from its series A round to expand its services in Germany, including hiring more staff for its operations. The company also plans to expand into other European markets, such as the Netherlands and Belgium, as well as further afield in the future. "We're excited to work with Target Global and our other investors to bring our vision to more homeowners across Germany and beyond," said Menten. "We know that there is huge potential for our platform to have a positive impact on the environment and the economy by helping people save energy and money.". Target Global, the lead investor in Enter's series A round, is a venture capital firm with extensive experience in investing in technology startups. The firm's portfolio includes successful companies such as Delivery Hero, Auto1 Group, and WeFox. "Enter is a great example of a company using technology to tackle a real-world problem in an innovative way," said Yaron Valler, partner at Target Global. "We believe that there is a huge opportunity for Enter to make a significant impact in the energy efficiency market, and we're excited to support its growth.". Enter's series A round is a significant milestone for the company, which was founded in 2019. The company has already established partnerships with major energy providers in Germany, such as E.ON and MVV, and is keen to expand further in the coming years. "We have ambitious plans for the future, and this funding round will help us to achieve them," said Menten. "We want to make Enter the go-to platform for home energy assessments and energy-saving renovations across Europe and beyond.". The investment in Enter also reflects growing interest in the energy efficiency market, which is set to grow significantly in the coming years. According to a report by the International Energy Agency (IEA), increasing energy efficiency could deliver half of the carbon emissions reductions needed to reach net-zero emissions by 2050. As more countries set ambitious climate targets and look to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, the market for energy efficiency products and services is likely to expand rapidly. For companies like Enter, which are using technology to make energy savings more accessible, the potential for growth is enormous.
