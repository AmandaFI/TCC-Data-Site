Eva Herzigová, a renowned Czech model, has transformed herself into a MetaHuman using Epic Games' groundbreaking technology. This state-of-the-art creation involved scanning Herzigová's body in a 70-camera rig while participating in a motion capture shoot to create a hyper-realistic digital avatar of herself. The digital avatar is designed to be re-dressed, posed, lit, and animated using motion capture or traditional animation. This implies that Herzigová's digital likeness will be virtually available for virtual fashion shows and modelling digital clothes. The technology behind this transformation was introduced by Epic Games in 2021 to create realistic digital humans, and it is set to revolutionize the fashion industry. The facial animation capture feature of the MetaHumans technology will even be available on iPhones this summer, making it more accessible to everybody. Herzigová is one of the early users of the technology, and she undoubtedly has set the bar high with her digital avatar. It appears the sports industry is also hopping on the digital bandwagon, with NBA superstar Luka Dončić also embracing the MetaHuman technology. Dončić has already introduced a MetaHuman version of himself. Herzigová's transformation into a MetaHuman is a significant milestone for the fashion industry. This technology will allow fashion designers, advertisers, and models to showcase their work in groundbreaking ways, revolutionizing the way we engage with fashion. It is evident that the rise of MetaHumans technology will radically change how we perceive the boundaries between the virtual world and reality.
