When Your Startup Fails... ShelfLife, a startup founded by Lillian Cartwright with her technical co-founder John Cline, was on a mission to revolutionize the beverage industry. Their idea was to create a two-sided marketplace for companies to find ingredients, negotiate prices, and invoice and pay in one place. The platform aimed to bring transparency to supply chains, which was a fundamental problem in the industry. However, despite raising over $300,000 and later $2.7 million to build the platform, the startup was forced to shut down due to the pandemic. According to Cartwright, their idea was grand, and they were excited to work on it. They spent months building the platform from scratch, getting the right employees on board, and fine-tuning the features. However, after launch, they found out that their problems were more significant than they had anticipated. The beverage industry was slower to change. The traditional practices embedded in the industry were challenging to overcome. Additionally, Cartwright found that their customer base wasn't as diverse as they had anticipated. Getting companies on board who were willing to adapt to a new technology and change their previous processes meant that the growth of their platform was slower than anticipated. In the beginning, ShelfLife was successful in raising funds, but then the pandemic hit. Cartwright struggled to raise further funds as there was a global economic downturn. Venture capital dried up, and businesses started to fold. ShelfLife, unfortunately, suffered the same fate. After much consideration, Cartwright had to make the tough decision of shutting down her startup. She wrote a blog post addressing the users of ShelfLife and its investors, stating, "It's not the end of the mission. We know, more than ever, the importance of our ideas, and we will continue to push for transparency in supply chains. Even though this chapter has ended, we are excited to see what comes next.". The beverage industry is still struggling with supply chain transparency. However, the pandemic has highlighted the fragility and inadequacies of traditional supply chain models. According to a recent article in Forbes Magazine, the beverage industry is one that has been hit hard due to the disruption in supply chains during the pandemic. Companies are now trying to find ways to be more efficient and transparent in their operations. Cartwright's vision of creating transparency in the supply chain will undoubtedly be on the minds of many entrepreneurs and business leaders worldwide, and maybe a solution will arise sometime soon. The failure of ShelfLife doesn't mean that startups should stop encouraging transparency in supply chains. Instead, it should serve as a learning opportunity. One of the key takeaways is that the right idea or vision for a startup doesn't guarantee success. It takes more than just a great idea. Several factors play into the success of a startup, including a good working environment, the right support systems, the right technical expertise, patience, and resilience. Cartwright's startup failed because they were on the right path but hit pause too soon. ShelfLife's struggle also highlights the importance of risk-taking. When you start a business, you need to take significant risks. However, it's essential to ensure they are informed risks. Risks should be calculated based on customer needs, market analysis, and competition. Most importantly, taking calculated risks means that even if your startup fails, the lessons learned will be invaluable. Cartwright's story should motivate entrepreneurs to keep pushing even when their startups fail. Her story proves that startups can fail, but the entrepreneurial spirit lives on. Good ideas will keep coming, and entrepreneurs will keep building. The only guarantee is that ideas will keep coming, and business leaders will continue to push their boundaries to make the impossible possible, even if that means starting over from scratch.
