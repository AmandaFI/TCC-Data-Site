Infogrid, the London-based startup that uses AI to analyze and collect data on air quality, occupancy, and energy consumption, has raised $90 million in its latest funding round. The Series B funding round was led by Northzone and includes participation from JLL Spark, Imaginable Futures, the University of Chicago, and existing investors including Jigsaw24, Force Over Mass Capital, and a founding investor of Skype. Infogrid's platform uses AI to gather data from IoT sensors installed in various buildings, helping property managers and owners optimize the buildings' performance. The company believes its technology will help address challenges in the buildings management sector, including the need to improve energy efficiency, monitoring air quality, and ensuring safety compliance. Infogrid has seen exponential growth in the number of data points collected per month, jumping from 500 million in 2020 to almost 4 billion. This growth has contributed to the company's success, as it has been able to provide actionable insights to customers on how to improve their building's performance. Additionally, an increase in regulations and customer demand for sustainability and tech-enabled buildings have played a major role in Infogrid's success. "We're thrilled to have closed a successful funding round that demonstrates the growing demand for our platform," said William Cowell de Gruchy, Infogrid's CEO. "Our technology helps property managers and owners optimize the performance of their buildings, while also addressing key sustainability challenges.". Infogrid's customers include large organizations, including the NHS, Sodexo, and BT. The company believes its technology will continue to play an essential role in addressing these organizations' challenges as they work to manage their buildings' performance, energy efficiency, and compliance. Infogrid plans to use the funding to accelerate product development, hire new talent, and expand its customer acquisition efforts. The startup is also looking to expand its product into new markets, including the United States and Asia. As part of the funding round, Pär-Jörgen Pärson, General Partner at Northzone, will be joining Infogrid's board of directors. "We believe Infogrid has the potential to change how buildings are managed in the future," said Pär-Jörgen Pärson. "Their AI-driven technology makes it possible to collect significant amounts of data and turn that data into actionable insights. We're excited to support Infogrid as it continues to grow and expand into new markets.". Infogrid competes with other firms in the buildings management space, including BrainBox and Facilio. However, the company believes its unique AI technology and focus on sustainability will set it apart in the market. Infogrid's latest funding round comes after the company raised $15.5 million in April 2021. The startup plans to use the funds to continue its expansion and accelerate the development of its technology. Overall, Infogrid's innovative approach to building management is quickly gaining traction in the market, as evidenced by its successful Series B funding round. With its unique AI technology, talented team, and focus on sustainability, Infogrid is well-positioned to become a leader in the buildings management space.
