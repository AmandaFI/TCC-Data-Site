Window AC units and air purifiers in the US are set to become more energy-efficient after the Department of Energy (DOE) announced new federal efficiency standards. The move is estimated to save consumers around $1.5 billion per year on electricity bills and help to reduce greenhouse gas pollution. The DOE's rules require all window air conditioners and portable air purifiers to meet minimum energy efficiency standards or risk being taken off the market. The new standards are also expected to ease pressure on power grids during heatwaves, allowing energy providers to avoid blackouts and reduce peak demand. The efficiency standards for portable air purifiers are a first for the DOE, with the new rules set to be implemented from 2024. This is a response to growing concerns about indoor air pollution and the health risks associated with it. The DOE hopes that the new standards will encourage manufacturers to develop more energy-efficient air purifiers that are also effective at removing pollutants from the air. The new standards for window air conditioners are a long overdue update. The DOE has raised federal efficiency standards for air conditioners three times since 1990, but the latest update takes into account advances in technology and the growing demand for more energy-efficient appliances. The new standards will require manufacturers to produce units with a minimum combined energy efficiency ratio (CEER) of at least 12.8 for smaller units and a variable-speed compressor for larger units above 8,000Btu/h. Manufacturers initially opposed the new rules, citing the disproportionate impact on low-income households. However, the DOE argues that the long-term cost savings for consumers will outweigh any short-term price increases for more energy-efficient appliances. The DOE's announcement has been welcomed by consumer groups and environmental advocates. The Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) estimates that the new standards will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by around 39 million metric tons by 2050, equivalent to the emissions from 8.4 million cars. John Walke, clean air director at the NRDC, said: "This is a major win for consumers' wallets, public health and the climate. By raising the bar on energy efficiency, we can keep bills low and help reduce pollution that harms our health and planet.". The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE) also praised the new standards, calling them a "smart move.". Jennifer Amann, buildings program director at the ACEEE, said: "The new standards for air conditioners and air purifiers will help Americans save money on their energy bills while also ensuring that our homes and businesses use energy more efficiently and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.". The DOE's new standards for window AC units and air purifiers are part of a wider effort to improve the energy efficiency of household appliances and reduce the amount of energy consumed by households. The agency is also considering new standards for other appliances, such as commercial air conditioners, refrigerators, and dishwashers. The move follows similar efforts in other countries to improve the energy efficiency of appliances. The European Union, for example, has implemented strict energy efficiency standards for a wide range of household appliances, from televisions to washing machines. The EU's Energy Label, which rates the energy efficiency of appliances from A+++ to D, has been widely adopted by manufacturers and has helped to drive innovation in energy-efficient appliances. The DOE's new rules are expected to have a similar effect in the US, encouraging manufacturers to invest in developing new technologies and products that meet the new standards. This could create new job opportunities and stimulate innovation in the energy efficiency sector. In conclusion, the DOE's new energy efficiency standards for window AC units and air purifiers are a significant step forward in reducing energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions in the US. The new rules are expected to save consumers money on their electricity bills while also improving the quality of indoor air. Manufacturers will need to adapt their products to meet the new standards, but this could stimulate innovation and create new opportunities in the energy efficiency sector.
