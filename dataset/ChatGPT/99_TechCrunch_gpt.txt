Swiss start-up UniSieve has raised $5.5m in seed funding from investors, including Wingman Ventures, the Amadeus Apex Technology Fund, CIECH Ventures, and Zürcher Kantonalbank, to pilot and expand its membrane technology which filters and separates CO2 and hydrocarbons while saving energy and reducing costs. UniSieve has been developing a revolutionary filtration system that could reduce industrial emissions significantly. Its new technology uses zeolitic materials integrated into polymeric membranes that can be added to existing manufacturing systems easily. This means that manufacturers can save energy and costs, while also reducing their carbon footprint. Zeolitic materials are crystals with a unique structure that allows them to act as a molecular sieve, meaning they can selectively filter certain molecules. UniSieve's technology utilizes these crystals to filter out CO2 and hydrocarbons from industrial processes, such as oil refining and chemical production. The technology, which is up to 90% more energy efficient than other new technologies, such as distillation or amine scrubbing, can be adapted to many applications, such as separating other gases. UniSieve's membrane solution is already helping industrial clients worldwide reduce their emissions and cut costs. According to UniSieve, the demand for its technology has been rising exponentially. The start-up is already making significant revenues and has over 24 clients, including some of the world's largest chemical producers and oil refineries. The $5.5m in seed funding will be used to pilot and expand UniSieve's membrane technology further. The start-up plans to scale up production and aggressively penetrate the multi-billion-dollar market for industrial filtration systems. "The funding will enable us to accelerate the development of our technology and extend our reach to more industrial clients globally," said Dr. Javier García-Martínez, CEO of UniSieve. "We are excited to have investors who share our vision of mitigating climate change through technological innovation.". UniSieve's investors were equally optimistic about the start-up's future. "We believe UniSieve offers a solution that not only benefits the environment but also significantly improves the economics of industrial processes," said Dr. Andreas Spechtler, Partner at Wingman Ventures. "We see massive potential in UniSieve's technology and its numerous applications.". UniSieve's technology comes at a critical time for the industrial sector, which is under increasing pressure to reduce emissions and meet climate targets. The pandemic has also highlighted the need for resilient supply chains and more sustainable manufacturing practices. UniSieve's membrane technology could prove to be a game-changer, allowing industrial companies to reduce their carbon footprint significantly while also improving their bottom line. The start-up's unique approach to filtration is undoubtedly one to watch.
