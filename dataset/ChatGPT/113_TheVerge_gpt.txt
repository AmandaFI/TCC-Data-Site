Rad Power Bikes, North America's largest seller of electric bikes, has partnered with battery recycling company Redwood Materials to recycle e-bike batteries. This partnership will help support Redwood Materials' consumer e-waste collection program while also building a domestic battery supply for the US. Customers can drop off their depleted batteries at Rad Power Bikes' retail locations, and the company will send them to Redwood Materials for processing and recycling. By partnering with Redwood Materials, Rad Power Bikes is taking a proactive role in ensuring the responsible disposal of e-bike batteries to reduce environmental impact while also supporting a circular economy. Founded by a former chief technology officer of Tesla, Redwood Materials can recycle and reuse over 95% of the critical metals found in lithium-ion batteries, including nickel, cobalt, copper, aluminum, lithium, and graphite. This approach to battery recycling minimizes the environmental impact of battery disposal and helps to recover valuable materials to be reused in new batteries. In addition to e-bike batteries, select Rad stores in California and Washington will serve as drop-off locations for old smartphones, laptops, and tablets for Redwood's growing consumer e-waste collection program. By expanding the range of electronics that can be recycled, Redwood Materials can recover more critical minerals, reduce environmental impacts, and help build a more sustainable supply chain. Rad Power Bikes' partnership with Redwood Materials will help to reduce the environmental impact of battery disposal while also recovering valuable materials for reuse. By working with Redwood Materials, Rad Power Bikes is helping to build a circular economy for lithium-ion batteries, which are increasingly used in consumer electronics and electric vehicles. This partnership also supports Redwood Materials' mission to build a sustainable battery supply chain in the US. Currently, most lithium-ion batteries are manufactured in Asia, where the technology was first developed. However, growing demand for electric vehicles, energy storage, and consumer electronics in the US is driving interest in developing a domestic battery supply chain. By recycling e-bike batteries and other consumer electronics, Redwood Materials can recover valuable materials to be reused in new products. This approach minimizes the environmental impact of mining new materials while also reducing the need for importing critical minerals from overseas. Rad Power Bikes' partnership with Redwood Materials reflects the company's commitment to sustainability and responsible business practices. By offering a convenient drop-off location for e-bike batteries and other electronics, the company is helping to reduce waste and promote sustainability. Rad Power Bikes is the latest company to partner with Redwood Materials, which has also worked with other electric vehicle manufacturers, including Ford and Lucid Motors, to recycle batteries. These partnerships are part of a broader trend towards creating a circular economy for lithium-ion batteries, which is essential to reducing the environmental impact of battery disposal and building a sustainable supply chain for critical minerals.
