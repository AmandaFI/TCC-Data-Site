Fintech startup Clear Street has closed a second tranche of its Series B funding round, raising $270m at a valuation of $2bn, led by growth equity firm Prysm Capital. The latest funding round brings the total raised to $435m, after the company secured its first tranche of funding in May 2022 at a valuation of $1.7bn. Clear Street, which is based in New York, provides prime brokerage services to institutional investors. Its cloud-native prime brokerage and clearing system aims to replace outdated infrastructure in the capital markets, and provides clients with a way to maximise returns while minimising risk and cost. With the funds raised, Clear Street plans to expand into new markets and asset classes. The company's growth strategy is focused on providing a world-class client experience through advanced technology and top-notch service. "The capital markets are undergoing a massive transformation and we are excited to be at the forefront of this change," said Clear Street CEO Bina Kalola. "This funding will help us continue to rapidly scale our business and deliver innovative products to our clients.". Clear Street was founded in 2018 by a team of Wall Street veterans who saw an opportunity to provide institutional investors with a better prime brokerage experience. The company has quickly gained traction in the market and now serves a broad range of clients in the US. "We are thrilled to partner with Prysm and our existing investors to accelerate the growth of our platform," said Kalola. "This funding will allow us to expand our product offerings and enter new markets, while maintaining our commitment to delivering exceptional service to our clients.". Clear Street's cloud-native platform gives institutional investors access to a range of services including margin financing, securities lending, and trade execution. The platform is designed to be easy to use and provides clients with a high level of transparency and control over their investments. "The Clear Street team has built an impressive platform that is transforming the way institutional investors access the capital markets," said Karan Mehta, Founder and Managing Partner of Prysm Capital. "We are excited to support the company as it enters its next phase of growth.". The growth of Clear Street is a reflection of the broader trend towards fintech disruption in the capital markets. As traditional banks and brokerages struggle to keep pace with technological change, startups like Clear Street are stepping in to fill the gap. In a recent interview, Kalola highlighted the importance of technology in driving the company's growth. "We've built a platform that is easy to use, transparent, and reliable," she said. "Our clients know that they can rely on us to provide them with the best-in-class service.". Clear Street's success has also attracted attention from other investors. Earlier this year, the company raised $120m in a Series A funding round led by Insight Partners. The company plans to continue to raise capital to support its growth as it expands into new markets and asset classes. As Clear Street continues to grow, it is likely to face increasing competition from other fintech startups in the prime brokerage space. However, with its cloud-native platform and commitment to providing exceptional service, the company is well positioned to continue to deliver value to its clients.
