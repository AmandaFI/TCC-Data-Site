OMERS Ventures, a venture capital firm, has partnered with Turner Construction, a leading construction company, to launch an Entrepreneur-in-Residence program aimed at incubating construction tech startups. Michelle Killoran, Principal at OMERS Ventures, and Jim Barrett, Chief Innovation Officer at Turner Construction, have joined forces to create a unique opportunity for aspiring entrepreneurs in the construction industry. The Entrepreneur-in-Residence program will select candidates who will spend three to six months at Turner Construction, working closely with the company's employees, clients, architects, engineers, and subcontractors. The aim of the program is not to create a software company that solely addresses Turner's challenges, but rather to establish a learning lab for founders to develop successful startups that provide technological solutions for the entire construction industry. While the construction industry has historically been slow in adopting new technologies, Killoran believes there is a massive opportunity for technology to revolutionize the sector. By leveraging automation and improving processes, technology can enhance productivity, streamline regulatory processes, facilitate design collaboration, and ensure payment predictability. The program encourages candidates with an entrepreneurial spirit and a passion for automating workflows and improving processes, rather than a specific construction background. The goal is to attract individuals who can think outside the box and bring fresh perspectives to the table. Killoran and Barrett's collaboration aims to bridge the gap between construction and technology. By providing aspiring entrepreneurs with the necessary resources, mentorship, and access to industry experts, the program seeks to foster innovation in construction tech. Candidates who are selected for the program will have the opportunity to explore various opportunities within Turner Construction. They will have access to invaluable insights and firsthand experience in the complexities of the construction industry. This immersive experience will serve as a foundation for their entrepreneurial journey, allowing them to identify pain points and develop solutions. Turner Construction, with its vast industry experience and network, will play a crucial role in helping the selected entrepreneurs navigate the challenges of the construction sector. The company's expertise and resources will provide the startups with a solid foundation to build upon. OMERS Ventures, on the other hand, will bring its extensive experience in venture capital and investment to the table. As a leading investor in growth-stage companies, OMERS Ventures will provide valuable guidance and support to the entrepreneurs as they work towards turning their ideas into successful businesses. The collaboration between OMERS Ventures and Turner Construction has the potential to revolutionize the construction industry by fostering innovation and driving technological advancements. By combining the expertise and resources of both entities, the Entrepreneur-in-Residence program aims to create a thriving ecosystem for construction tech startups to flourish. The program is currently accepting applications from aspiring entrepreneurs who are passionate about transforming the construction industry through technology. Selected candidates will not only gain invaluable knowledge and experience during their time at Turner Construction but will also receive financial support to help them kickstart their startup journey. The program has already generated significant interest within the construction and technology communities. Entrepreneurs and industry professionals alike are excited about the opportunity to collaborate and disrupt the construction industry. With the support of OMERS Ventures and Turner Construction, the future looks promising for construction tech startups. The program's emphasis on nurturing innovation and providing entrepreneurs with the necessary tools to succeed sets it apart from traditional incubator programs. The construction industry is on the cusp of a technological revolution, and the OMERS Ventures- Turner Construction partnership is leading the way in constructing the future with groundbreaking startups that will transform the way we build.
