Snap CEO Evan Spiegel on TikTok ban: ‘We’d love that’. Snapchat is looking to attract and retain Gen Z users, and the company is taking bold steps to compete with TikTok. During the Snap Partner Summit, Snap CEO Evan Spiegel discussed the growth of TikTok and said that the company would "love it" if TikTok was banned. However, he also acknowledged the need for a regulatory framework to deal with security concerns around technology. Snapchat Spotlight, Snap's TikTok competitor, now has 350 million monthly users, and the company is investing in augmented reality (AR) and artificial intelligence (AI) to differentiate itself. The company recently introduced its creator program to encourage users to make original content for the platform, similar to the approach taken by TikTok. Despite the positive growth for Snapchat, there are concerns about the company's fast-paced technological developments. The release of its in-app AI chatbot, My AI, has raised concerns among experts. While 99.5% of My AI responses abide by community guidelines, there is concern about what could occur with the remaining 0.5%. Snapchat's My AI chatbot was launched last year to provide users with personalized assistance in a variety of areas, including ordering food and booking appointments. The chatbot utilizes natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning to understand and respond to user queries. However, the concern is that the chatbot could be used to distribute harmful content or misinformation if not properly regulated. Snap CEO Evan Spiegel acknowledged the potential risks of My AI during the Sum Partner Summit. He stated that the company is working to ensure that My AI is used responsibly and that it will comply with any regulatory frameworks that are put in place. Spiegel also highlighted the importance of transparency and accountability in ensuring that the technology is used ethically. Snapchat is not alone in facing scrutiny over AI chatbots. Other tech companies, including Amazon and Google, have faced criticism over the use of their chatbots to spread misinformation and harmful content. The concern is that without proper regulation, these chatbots could be used to manipulate public opinion and further exacerbate social and political divisions. To address these concerns, countries around the world are introducing regulations aimed at ensuring the responsible use of AI technology. In the United States, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has developed a set of guidelines for AI, while the European Union recently introduced its first-ever set of regulations for AI. Snapchat's response to the growth of TikTok highlights the company's commitment to competing in the fast-paced world of social media. However, the risks associated with My AI highlight the need for responsible innovation and regulation in the development of new technologies. As AI continues to evolve and become more integrated into our daily lives, it is essential that companies prioritize the responsible use of these technologies to ensure their long-term viability.
