Klarna, the Swedish fintech company, has announced its latest update which includes a suite of new features to give users a more personalized shopping experience. With the goal of becoming an overall shopping destination for its 150 million users, Klarna has introduced "Ask Klarna", a personal shopping assistant, and "Creator Shops", a customized storefront for content creators. Additionally, there is an AI-powered discovery shopping feed and a resell functionality, among other new tools. The new personal shopping assistant, "Ask Klarna," offers users the opportunity to speak to real fashion experts for advice and information about products from thousands of brands and stores. Initially limited to luxury fashion items, the service will soon expand to other expensive items such as TVs, smartphones, drones, and other electronics. It aims to offer a more hands-on approach to shopping, allowing customers to ask questions and receive expert guidance before making purchases. Additionally, the new personalized and AI-powered discovery shopping feed is designed to help consumers find relevant products based on their preferences. The algorithm takes into account the user's browsing history, purchase history, and other relevant data to suggest products that may interest them. This feature aims to offer a more personalized shopping experience and reduce the time users spend browsing for products. For content creators, Klarna's Creator Shops offer a customized storefront for them to feature products and promote them to their followers. Creators can select products from over 250,000 stores and brands on the Klarna platform, making it easier for their followers to purchase the items they recommend. This feature aims to give creators more control over their recommendations, as well as the opportunity to earn commission on sales. Another interesting feature of the update is the resell functionality, allowing users to resell products they no longer need or want, creating a more sustainable approach to shopping. Sellers can list items for sale on the Klarna platform and receive payment once the product is sold, making the process simple and convenient. Commenting on the new features, Klarna's CEO, Sebastian Siemiatkowski, said, "As we continue to grow, we're constantly looking for ways to enhance the shopping experience for our users. These new features offer a more personalized approach to shopping, giving customers more control over their purchases, and making it easier for creators to showcase their recommendations.". Klarna's latest update comes as the company continues to expand its presence in the US market, with partnerships with major retailers such as H&M and Sephora. With the new tools and features introduced, Klarna aims to offer a more comprehensive shopping experience to its users, making it easier for them to find relevant products and make informed purchases. The company's focus on personalization and sustainability is also a welcome change in a world where more and more consumers are looking for a more conscious and ethical approach to shopping.
