California-based Congruent Ventures, a venture capital firm focused on climate technology, has successfully closed a Continuity Fund worth $300m. Despite a drop in both value and deal count for climate tech investments in Q1 2021, the firm's limited partners (LPs) pushed for a broader offering of investment opportunities in their portfolio companies. The Continuity Fund will provide follow-on financing for portfolio companies, including technology companies AMP Robotics, Servo Energy, Span.IO, and Avalanche Energy. While the new fund will provide additional financing for earlier investments, Congruent Ventures does not see it as a diversion from early stage funding. According to managing partner Abe Yokell, the move was driven by the firm's LPs' appetite for more investment opportunities in portfolio companies. Congruent Ventures has been committed to investing in startups focused on tackling climate change from the outset. In the last few years, the firm has ramped up its investments in climate tech, raising two funds worth $92m and $175m respectively, with a focus on technologies that address global challenges like climate change, food and water security, and the circular economy. Despite the dip in the Q1 2021 climate tech investment numbers, investment in the sector has been seeing growing interest in the midst of the global focus on sustainability and clean energy. Congruent Ventures is one of several VC firms looking to increase investments in emerging sectors of the clean energy industry. California has been pushing hard towards achieving zero net emissions by 2045 and investing in renewable energy and the electrification of transportation to achieve that goal. With billions of dollars flowing into climate tech investments annually, Congruent Ventures' Continuity Fund is expected to attract more LPs, and could also help to encourage the growth of climate tech startups globally.
