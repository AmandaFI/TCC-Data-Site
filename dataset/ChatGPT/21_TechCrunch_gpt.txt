Blinded by the speed of change. As the world continues to witness rapid technological advancements, some people are beginning to feel dizzy from the speed of change. This was the experience of one writer who recently shared her observations regarding her personal journey through the ever-changing technological landscape. From the early days of the automobile to the latest innovations in the field of generative artificial intelligence (AI), technology has been transforming the world at a breakneck speed. The writer notes that recent developments such as ChatGPT 4 and internet plug-ins are happening at an unprecedented rate and feel like an inflection point similar to the dawn of personal computing, connected computing, and mobile computing. However, while these innovations have undoubtedly revolutionized the world we live in, it remains unclear how they will transform our lives in the long-term. For example, the writer points out that we did not anticipate the impact that smartphones and the internet would have when they were first introduced. Despite the potential uncertainty surrounding such developments, the pace of change has continued to accelerate. At a recent discussion panel, one participant likened the current wave of technological change to the early days of the internet, emphasizing that like then, we are once again at a crossroads within this new technological landscape. The writer also noted that while we may have been able to predict the ways in which the internet has changed our lives, the pace of innovation is becoming harder to keep up with. In the earlier stages of technological advancements, it was easier to anticipate the value that new technology could bring to our lives and businesses. However, today's innovations are happening at such a dizzying pace that it has become increasingly difficult to keep up, let alone predict the impact. While technological advancements may be difficult to keep up with, it is crucial that we do so as it is only through understanding these latest inventions that we can harness their potential. It is also important to recognize the ethical hurdles that technology may pose and work towards solutions that can benefit all users. As we continue to feel the impact of generative AI and other emerging technologies, it is essential not to be overwhelmed by the pace of change. Instead, we must engage with it, absorb it, and learn how we can leverage it to create a better future for all. The writer's account serves as a gentle reminder that technological change is a double-edged sword; although it can offer enormous benefits to society, it can also blind us to the long-term impact of those changes. But by keeping an open mind and remaining curious, we can stay ahead of the curve and harness the power of technological innovation in a way that benefits all of us.
