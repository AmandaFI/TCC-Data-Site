Bristol University Student Creates AI App to Stop Cheats Using Essay Bot. A student at Bristol University has developed an innovative artificial intelligence (AI) app that can detect whether an essay has been generated by a bot. Ed Daniels, 22, developed his software start-up AIED.UK after a university project asked him to integrate AI with education. With the rise of essay bots, the issue of academic cheating has become a hot topic of conversation in recent years, with concerns that students are using these tools to write their coursework to get ahead in their academic careers. The app works by detecting whether language in the essay is too precisely chosen, indicating that a bot has been used. The software engineer hopes the project will tackle academic inequality, as standard models for essay-writing bots are the preserve of the wealthy, with fees of Â£20 ($26) per month. Daniels says that the idea for the app came to him after witnessing a friend cheating on an assignment using an essay bot. Frustrated by the lack of tools universities had to detect cheating, Daniels set out to develop his own solution to the problem. In creating the app, Daniels spent months developing AI algorithms that could identify patterns in written language associated with essay bot use. He also worked on ways to integrate this technology with a range of different educational platforms to create a user-friendly system that educators could easily access and use. As well as helping to tackle the problem of academic cheating, Daniels hopes that his app will encourage students to think more deeply about the content of their essays, and help to promote a culture of academic honesty and integrity. Speaking about his new project, Daniels said: "There are so many students out there who are desperate to get ahead in their academic careers, and who feel like they can't compete with those who are using essay bots to cheat. My hope is that our app will help to level the playing field and promote a culture of academic honesty and integrity.". The app has been welcomed by educators and students alike, with many praising Daniels' efforts to tackle this growing problem. Many believe that the app will be an essential tool for universities looking to detect essay-bot use, and will help to ensure that all students have a fair and equal chance to succeed in their academic careers. Looking to the future, Daniels hopes to expand his range of educational tools and develop new apps that can help to support students throughout their academic careers. With his passion for innovation and commitment to improving the world of education, he is sure to make a lasting impact in the years to come.
