Listen to an AI voice actor try and flirt with you. Sonantic, a startup specializing in AI voice technology, has announced a groundbreaking development in the world of audio deepfakes. The company claims to have created a synthetic voice that can express subtleties like teasing and flirtation, providing a new level of realism to AI-generated voices. Sonantic believes that incorporating non-speech sounds, such as intakes of breath and small vocalizations, into its audio models allows it to recreate the nuances of human speech. This breakthrough offers a more immersive experience for users interacting with AI voices. Describing its software as "Photoshop for voice," Sonantic allows users to type out the desired speech they want to synthesize, specify the mood of the delivery, and select from a wide range of AI voices. The level of customization offered by Sonantic is said to be more in-depth than that of its rivals, with options for anger, fear, sadness, happiness, joy, flirting, coy, teasing, and boasting among others. While Sonantic primarily serves triple-A game studios and entertainment studios, the company has recently partnered with Mercedes to customize its in-car digital assistant. This partnership showcases the potential for AI voices to be integrated into various applications beyond traditional entertainment. However, critics highlight that while the demo of Sonantic's technology is impressive, the raw audio samples are less polished. This suggests that manual adjustments are still needed to fine-tune the output of the AI voices. This raises questions about the readiness and reliability of the technology, particularly when it comes to real-world usage. Moreover, the ethical implications of utilizing a flirtatious AI voice are also being debated. Concerns have been raised regarding manipulation and the representation of gender in the tech industry. Some argue that deploying a flirtatious AI voice could contribute to further objectification and reinforce harmful stereotypes. In response to these concerns, Sonantic assures that it takes great care in how and where it deploys its AI voices, primarily focusing on the entertainment industry. By being selective in its choice of applications, the company aims to avoid any potential negative implications and misuse. Implementing AI-generated voices in various industries has gained significant attention in recent years. From virtual assistants to video games, AI voices have shown great potential in enhancing user experience. However, there is a pressing need to address the ethical considerations surrounding the technology's deployment. The debate over the ethical use of AI voices continues to evolve, with voices from academia, industry experts, and activists joining the conversation. It is crucial to examine the possible consequences and ensure that AI technology is developed and used responsibly. Sonantic's commitment to prioritizing ethical practices and careful usage of AI voices is noteworthy, as it sets an example for other developers in the field. As the technology continues to advance, it is paramount that industry stakeholders work together to establish guidelines and regulations to ensure the responsible implementation of AI-generated voices. While the concept of an AI voice attempting to flirt with users may seem intriguing or entertaining to some, it is essential to consider the broader societal impact and avoid perpetuating harmful narratives. With the right precautions and discussions, AI voice technology can offer innovative and engaging experiences without compromising ethical considerations.
