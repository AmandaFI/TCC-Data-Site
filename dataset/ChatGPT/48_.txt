Yahoo has announced its acquisition of Wagr, a social sports betting start-up based in Nashville, with plans to integrate the platform into its existing sports offerings to create the "most compelling fantasy and gaming products". The terms of the deal have not been disclosed, but Yahoo Sports is looking to expand its reach into new group formats that foster camaraderie and friendly competition. Wagr allows sports fans to place bets alongside friends, with challenges, leaderboards and tools for "smack talk" all part of the fun. Yahoo Sports already ranks among the largest fantasy sports firms in the US, but the integration of Wagr is expected to provide a unique edge in the market. The additional features, such as the ability to bet with friends and track progress on leaderboards, could help Yahoo Sports better engage with its audience and keep them coming back for more. "We're excited to welcome Wagr to Yahoo Sports and deliver a new level of fun and competition to sports fans," said Geoff Reiss, general manager of Yahoo Sports. "With Wagr's innovative platform and Yahoo's extensive experience in fantasy sports, we're confident we can create the most engaging sports gaming experience available on the market today.". Wagr co-founder Leo Barnes echoed Reiss's sentiment, stating that "joining forces with Yahoo Sports will allow us to bring our unique social betting platform to a much larger audience". Barnes added that the team was "thrilled to be part of Yahoo's vision for delivering next-generation sports and gaming experiences". The acquisition comes as the popularity of sports betting continues to rise in the US. With more states legalizing sports betting, investors have poured money into the industry, and companies are racing to capture a share of the market. There has been speculation that Yahoo's parent company, Verizon, may be looking to sell off the sports-focused division, but this acquisition seems to signal a commitment to the space. "We're constantly evaluating opportunities to grow our business and better serve our customers," said a Verizon spokesperson. "This acquisition is part of that ongoing process.".
