A new report by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) has found that relying on carbon capture and storage (CCS) to address climate change while allowing coal and gas power plants to continue operating will result in higher electricity prices for consumers. CCS technology works by capturing carbon dioxide emissions from power plant smokestacks for transportation and storage. However, the IEEFA report noted that CCS can cost consumers 1.5 to 2 times more than other renewable energy alternatives such as wind and solar. The IEEFA report also highlighted that transporting and storing CO2 incurs significant costs. Even if carbon capture were to become more efficient and less expensive in the future, the costs of storing the captured CO2 would always be a significant factor that would make CCS an expensive option. Despite the optimistic outlook of some technology providers, the report’s findings clearly show that CCS will make electricity more expensive for consumers – and that it’s unlikely the costs associated with CCS will decrease anytime soon. The cost of using coal or gas with CCS is likely to remain very high, making the technology viable only for niche applications such as small-scale industrial or petrochemical applications. Additionally, the study found that CCS is not a solution to hard-to-access oil reserves, as some fossil fuel companies have suggested. Instead, the CCS process is often used to produce more oil by pumping CO2 into previously inaccessible reserves, a process known as enhanced oil recovery. The report highlights that energy providers may use CCS technology as a way to present themselves as “climate heroes”, when in reality they are simply prolonging the use of fossil fuels rather than transitioning to renewable energy sources and truly reducing carbon output. The research also found environmental risks associated with CCS can be substantial. Pipelines for transporting carbon dioxide could rupture, leading to large releases of the greenhouse gas, which can be highly toxic at high concentrations. The report found that if these emissions occurred close to populated areas, it could lead to significant harm to human health and the environment. Although full-scale deployment of CCS is unlikely to happen in the foreseeable future, there is a growing focus on the technology as countries attempt to reduce emissions in the fight against climate change. Governments need to be aware of the limitations, risks and expense of CCS in terms of transitioning to clean energy sources. . “The risks are significant, and as often happens with new technologies, we tend to focus on the upsides whilst minimising risks and downsides, which can count against us in the long run," said Tim Buckley, director of energy finance studies at IEEFA. Whilst the report paints a bleak picture for the future of CCS, it also notes that CCS can play an important role in the decarbonisation of heavy industry, where alternatives such as electrification are not yet viable. Certain industrial applications still require the use of fossil fuels as a feedstock or for high-temperature processes, and CCS can help to reduce emissions. The report concludes that, although CCS may have a role to play in specific situations, it is not an effective means of tackling climate change and meeting emissions targets. Instead, countries should focus their efforts on phasing out the use of fossil fuels and transitioning to renewable energy sources such as wind, solar, and hydro power. “Governments should focus on incentivising the use of renewable energy sources, not prolonging the use of fossil fuels,” said Buckley. “Transitioning to renewables, backed up by gas power as necessary, is a more cost-effective way to address the challenge of climate change while ensuring a secure and affordable energy supply for consumers.”. In short, although CCS may have its place in niche applications such as small-scale industrial or petrochemical applications, the IEEFA’s report makes it clear that it is not a practical solution to tackling climate change and would make electricity more expensive for consumers. Instead, we need to focus on phasing out the use of fossil fuels and transitioning to renewable energy sources, which offer a more cost-effective and sustainable solution.
