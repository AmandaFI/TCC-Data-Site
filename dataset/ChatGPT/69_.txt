President Joe Biden says US canâ€™t buy spyware that other countries have used against it. President Joe Biden signed an executive order on Wednesday that forbids federal agencies from using commercial spyware that could pose counterintelligence or security risks to the US or be improperly used by a foreign government or person. The order comes as concerns mount over the use of spyware by foreign adversaries to steal national secrets, gain access to sensitive information, and even influence politics. While not an outright ban on spyware, the order disqualifies software that steals information and data from devices without the users' knowledge. It also requires government agencies to consider whether the vendor knew the software would be abused when selling it and whether the spyware has been used against the US before taking "appropriate measures.". "Americans deserve to have the best protections against foreign adversaries and those who would misuse digital technology to infringe on our rights or influence our democracy," Biden said in a statement accompanying the order. "Spyware that steals information from devices without the user's knowledge poses a grave threat to our national security, and we must take every measure to ensure that it doesn't fall into the wrong hands.". The new order is a significant step forward in the fight against cyber espionage, which has become an increasingly potent weapon in the hands of foreign adversaries seeking to steal sensitive information or influence US politics from afar. The move represents a break from the previous administration, which had taken a more laissez-faire approach to the issue of cyber espionage. Under the Trump administration, government agencies were encouraged to use commercial spyware to monitor employees and contractors, raising concerns about the potential for abuse by foreign governments or cybercriminals. By contrast, the Biden administration has made it clear that it will be taking a much harder line in the fight against cyber espionage. In addition to the executive order, the administration has also announced new measures to improve the cybersecurity of critical infrastructure, including the electrical grid and water systems. The order also comes as tensions between Apple and the Israeli cybersecurity firm NSO Group have been heating up.  Apple has sued the company, alleging that it used its Pegasus spyware to target the iPhones of journalists, human rights activists and politicians. The lawsuit claims that NSO Group is guilty of violating the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act and California Comprehensive Computer Data Access and Fraud Act, among other allegations. NSO Group has denied any wrongdoing, saying that its software is intended for use by governments to combat terrorism and other forms of public safety threats. The company has also accused Apple of unfairly maligning its technology and trying to block its access to the iPhone market. The dispute has led to calls for increased regulation of commercial spyware, with critics saying that the software should be subject to tighter controls and oversight. Some have called for a global treaty to ban the use of cyberweapons, much as chemical and biological weapons are banned under international law. For its part, Apple has introduced a "Lockdown Mode" for its devices to prevent the installation of spyware. The new feature, which was rolled out last year, disables the ability to install new apps or delete existing ones, effectively locking down the device and preventing any unauthorized access. The move has been hailed by privacy advocates, who say that it represents a major step forward in protecting users' data from cyber threats. But some have argued that it is not enough, and that more needs to be done to combat the growing threat of cyber espionage. Overall, the executive order represents a significant step forward in the fight against cyber espionage. By forbidding federal agencies from using commercial spyware that could pose a risk to national security, the order sends a clear message to foreign adversaries that the US is taking this issue seriously. And with Apple leading the way in introducing new security measures for its devices, it's clear that the private sector is also taking action to protect users from cyber threats.
