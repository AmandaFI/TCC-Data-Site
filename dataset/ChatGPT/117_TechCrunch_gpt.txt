Singapore-based startup, Betterdata, has secured $1.55m in seed funding from a range of investors, including Investible, Franklin Templeton, and Xcel Next, as well as Singapore University of Technology and Design, Bon Auxilium, Tenity, Plug and Play and Entrepreneur First. The round was oversubscribed and will be used to launch its product and enhance its technology stack. Betterdata specializes in using programmable synthetic data to keep real data secure, and is currently in development partnerships with two major unnamed universities in Singapore and the US. Betterdata's core offering is materials sourced from generative AI and privacy engineering used to create fictional versions of real datasets that can be utilized safely, reducing bias, and improving machine-learning models. Its aim is to support single-table, multi-table, and time-series datasets. As well as expanding beyond Singapore, the company plans to recruit additional staff to join its team with the funds raised from this latest round of investment. CEO of Betterdata, Vathsala Narasimhan stated that the company's services work to provide a "fiduciary responsibility" to data owners related to how their data is managed and secured. Its programmable synthetic data is an effective technique that Betterdata uses to ensure data confidentiality and reduce the risk of data breaches and cyber-attacks. Betterdata's generative AI can produce synthetic data securely to within a few percent of the real data. This is particularly useful when the real data cannot be shared due to regulations, such as with health records or other sensitive personal information. The generated data is then used as a substitute for the real data, helping to protect data privacy and confidentiality without compromising the quality of the results. The company's mission is to provide businesses with a trustworthy environment to perform data science. Betterdata believes that data science is an essential element to enable companies to achieve their strategic objectives, and it is committed to creating an ecosystem where privacy and security concerns are met to enable businesses to flourish. With the support of investors from the latest funding round, Betterdata was able to focus on enhancing its product and achieving technological milestones. By developing partnerships with universities in Singapore and the US, its technology will be put to the test in rigorous research and development environments to encourage new ideas and improve Betterdata's offering. Betterdata hopes to emerge as one of the leading companies providing synthetic data services, which support better management and security of data without compromising its quality or utility. In this innovative field, the company is making a difference by introducing solutions that better support data science while ensuring data confidentiality and security.
