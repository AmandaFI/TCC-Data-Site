RapidAPI, valued at $1 billion last year, cuts staff by 50%. API marketplace startup Rapid, previously known as RapidAPI, has announced that it will be laying off 50% of its staff in a bid to "right-size the company". The move comes following the departure of the company's former CEO and founder, Iddo Gino, who is now a technical advisor. The layoffs are reported to have impacted 115 staff members across multiple departments in Tel Aviv, Europe and San Francisco. According to a company spokesperson, the decision to reduce its headcount was made as part of a larger restructuring effort that has been seen at other technology firms. "Recently, we have seen a trend of technology firms rebalancing investments and reducing headcount as part of a bigger strategy," the spokesperson stated. "This decision was not one that was taken lightly, but one that we felt was necessary to ensure the long-term success of Rapid.". Founded in 2015, Rapid was valued at $1bn last year and had raised $150m in a Series D funding round in March 2022, led by SoftBank's Vision Fund 2. The company operates a marketplace that allows developers to find, test and integrate APIs from a range of software providers. Despite the layoffs, Rapid is said to be continuing with its plans to grow its platform and expand its customer base. In a statement, the company noted that it had recently hired new executives to lead various functions within the company, including sales, marketing and product. "We remain committed to our mission of helping developers and enterprises more easily create, innovate and connect," the statement read. "We will continue to invest in improving our platform, building better tools for developers, and creating more value for our customers.". The news of Rapid's staff cuts comes amid a broader trend of tech firms implementing restructuring efforts in response to changing market conditions. In recent months, companies such as Airbnb, Uber and WeWork have all announced similar measures aimed at cutting costs and streamlining operations. Some industry experts have suggested that the recent trend of layoffs and restructuring may be indicative of a broader slowdown in venture capital funding. With investors becoming increasingly cautious, many startups are being forced to focus on profitability rather than growth. "As the economic climate shifts, investors are becoming more discerning about where they put their money," said Sam Altman, CEO of startup accelerator OpenAI. "Startups that are heavily focused on growth may find it harder to secure funding going forward.". Despite the challenges facing the startup ecosystem, Rapid remains confident in its ability to weather the storm and emerge stronger in the long run. "Our industry is constantly evolving, and we must be nimble and strategic in our approach in order to stay ahead of the curve," the company spokesperson said. "We are confident that our new leadership team, coupled with our talented and passionate staff, will enable us to continue delivering innovative solutions to our customers and drive growth for the company.".
