Are we ready for the smart front door? Masonite thinks so. Door manufacturer Masonite has made a groundbreaking announcement at CES 2022 by unveiling the first residential smart door. The M-Pwr Smart Door, created in collaboration with popular brands Ring and Yale, is an innovative fiberglass door that combines power, lighting, sensors, a video doorbell, and a smart lock all in one. One of the main concerns with smart devices is the need to constantly recharge batteries. However, Masonite has addressed this issue by incorporating an integrated power solution into the door. This eliminates the hassle of having to regularly change or charge batteries. The M-Pwr Smart Door is equipped with several cutting-edge features. It includes a Ring Video doorbell, a Yale Assure smart lock, a PIR motion sensor, a door state sensor, and motion-activated LED lighting. In addition, it has its own smart hub and a built-in backup battery. These components can also be upgraded in the future, allowing for potential enhancements and integrations with other companies. Currently, the door requires the use of three separate apps for the doorbell, lock, and programming features. This can be seen as a drawback, as it adds complexity to the user experience. However, Masonite aims to streamline this process in future versions of the smart door. At present, the M-Pwr Smart Door is primarily targeted towards new home construction. Builders will determine the pricing of the door, which is expected to reflect the premium features and technology it offers. However, Masonite has plans to expand into the renovation market within the next one to two years. This would make the smart door accessible to a wider range of homeowners, regardless of whether they are building a new house or renovating an existing one. It is important to note that the installation of the M-Pwr Smart Door is not a do-it-yourself project. The door requires professional installation and the assistance of an electrician. This ensures that the door is correctly connected to a home's electrical system and Wi-Fi network, guaranteeing optimal performance. Despite its limitations and installation requirements, the M-Pwr Smart Door represents a major step towards a fully integrated smart home. The door prioritizes safety and security while offering a range of convenient features that enhance the overall homeowner experience. Masonite's collaboration with Ring and Yale, two leading brands in the smart home industry, highlights the door manufacturer's commitment to delivering high-quality and innovative solutions. By integrating multiple smart devices into a single front door, Masonite has created a product that not only offers convenience but also elevates the security of residential properties. As technology continues to advance, it is likely that smart doors will become increasingly common in homes. Masonite's M-Pwr Smart Door sets a precedent for the industry and paves the way for future developments in the field of smart home integration. Whether we are truly ready for the smart front door or not, Masonite certainly believes so. With their groundbreaking M-Pwr Smart Door, they aim to revolutionize the way we enter and secure our homes, taking us one step closer to the fully integrated smart home of the future.
