Apple has announced a new feature that will notify subscribers when their payment method has failed, ultimately helping to avoid any disruptions to their app subscriptions. The feature will prompt users to update their payment details themselves, without requiring any input from developers. The alert will appear within the app in a system-provided sheet, giving users the option to update their current payment card or switch to a new one. This means Apple will manage all billing issues directly within its own App Store, resulting in a streamlined process for both users and developers. The new feature will roll out automatically this summer, with no additional requirements needed from developers to support it. Apple hopes that this will make the App Store more user-friendly and hassle-free for everyone involved. Previously, developers had to manage app subscription billing issues themselves, which resulted in some difficulties and delays. The new feature aims to simplify the process by allowing Apple to handle everything related to billing, reducing the workload for developers and providing a better user experience for subscribers. This news comes just a few months after Apple changed its App Store policies, lowering its commission rate for developers who earn up to $1 million annually. The company is also facing increasing scrutiny over its app store policies, with critics accusing Apple of anti-competitive practices. The new feature, however, is likely to be welcomed by both developers and subscribers alike. For users, it means less hassle in managing their subscription payments, and for developers, it means fewer billing issues to deal with. Overall, it's a win-win for all involved. Karim Hijazi, CEO of cybersecurity company Prevailion, said, “The payment prompt change seems to be a significant improvement for both developers and users. This new approach by Apple should lead to increased success rates of prompt payment receipts, which reduces churn for developers and ensures users can enjoy uninterrupted access to their subscriptions.”. In conclusion, this new feature from Apple is set to make a big difference to app subscribers and developers alike. By streamlining the billing process and removing the need for developers to handle it themselves, everyone involved should benefit from a smoother and more user-friendly experience. The feature is set to roll out this summer, and with no additional support required from developers, it should be a welcome addition to the App Store.
