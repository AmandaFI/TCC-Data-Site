Neosapience, a Korean startup specializing in synthetic voice and video platforms, has secured $21.5 million in a Series B funding round. The funding will be used to bring its AI-powered platform, Typecast, to the US market. Founded in 2017 by former Qualcomm engineers, Neosapience initially focused on providing an AI voice service. However, the company recently expanded its offerings by including an AI-powered video feature. With the latest funding, Neosapience aims to accelerate its growth, expand into new regions, and add support for additional languages such as Spanish and Japanese. Typecast allows users to transform text into a video without the need for recording and editing in a studio. This revolutionary approach significantly reduces both cost and time. The platform incorporates advanced technologies that enable the creation of human-like emotions, diverse speaking styles, and even rap voices. The impact of Typecast on creatives and content creators cannot be overstated. In just two years since its launch in 2019, Neosapience has garnered over 1 million users, a testament to the platform's value proposition. Furthermore, the company's revenue has shown steady growth, increasing by approximately 18% each month. The synthetic avatars created with Typecast offer a range of applications. They can be used in video games, films, advertisements, and virtual assistants. The avatars possess a high degree of realism, making them suitable for a multitude of creative projects. By securing the funding, Neosapience aims to expedite its expansion plans, with the US market as its foremost target. The company recognizes the potential of the American market and intends to capitalize on the growing demand for AI-powered content creation tools. Additionally, Neosapience plans to make Typecast available in various languages to cater to a broader user base. The funding round was led by US-based venture capital firm Zodius Capital, signaling Neosapience's commitment to establishing a strong presence in the American market. The backing from a prominent venture capital firm not only provides the necessary financial resources but also validates the potential and viability of Neosapience's innovative platform. The CEO of Neosapience, Dr. Harry Choi, expressed excitement about the funding and the opportunities it brings. He stated, "This investment will enable us to bring our industry-leading technology, which merges together the worlds of artificial intelligence and creative content creation, to creators around the world.". Dr. Choi further emphasized Neosapience's commitment to pushing the boundaries of technology. He revealed plans to continue investing in research and development, with a focus on enhancing Typecast's capabilities and incorporating more natural language processing and computer vision technologies. With the expansion into the US market, Neosapience aims to propel Typecast as the go-to platform for content creators seeking efficient and cost-effective ways to incorporate AI-powered synthetic avatars into their projects. This expansion opens up a vast array of opportunities for the company, as it taps into the world's largest market for entertainment and creative content. Neosapience's Typecast has already revolutionized the content creation landscape with its AI-powered voice and video capabilities. With the latest funding, the company is poised to make an even larger impact, expanding its reach and empowering creators to bring their imaginations to life with unprecedented ease. As Neosapience continues to push the boundaries of technology, the potential for further innovation within the content creation industry is immense.
