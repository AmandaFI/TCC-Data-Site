The airport tech helping to prevent delayed flights. Flight delays have long been a frustrating and common occurrence for travelers. From late ground crews to inclement weather, there are numerous factors that can disrupt an efficient turnaround process. However, Israeli startup IntellAct is aiming to tackle this issue head-on with its high-tech solution that utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) software to monitor and optimize turnaround services. IntellAct's system focuses on three key aspects of the turnaround process: aircraft cleaning, refueling, and restocking. By utilizing existing security and observation cameras at airports, the system automatically detects delays and suggests real-time mitigation plans. The goal is to reduce turnaround times, ultimately decreasing the chances of delayed flights. Preliminary tests of IntellAct's system were conducted at Israel's Ben Gurion Airport, showcasing promising results. The AI-powered software was able to potentially reduce turnaround times by 15%. This is a significant improvement that could have a substantial impact on minimizing flight delays. While IntellAct's system appears to offer a promising solution, experts raise concerns about the implementation of such high-tech monitoring systems at airports. Oxford University Professor Sandra Wachter voices her worries about the potential stress and dehumanization that may result from monitoring employees' work performance and incentivizing speed. Prof Wachter argues that the pressure to work faster could lead to mistakes or accidents, which would be particularly dangerous in the air traffic industry where the stakes are high. It is important to strike a balance between utilizing technology to streamline processes and ensuring the well-being and safety of airport employees. Despite concerns about the potential drawbacks of high-tech monitoring systems, the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the adoption of new technologies within the travel industry. Travel industry expert Paul Charles notes that the pandemic has made people more comfortable with using mobile phones for displaying tickets and personal information. As a result, he predicts that smartphones will eventually replace national passports, with digital certificates downloaded onto the phone and smart cameras reading the information as passengers walk by. Some airlines, such as Delta, have already started trialing facial recognition technology for passport verification. The goal is to create a seamless and efficient journey experience for passengers. While this advancement offers convenience, privacy concerns surrounding the use of databases with detailed personal information, including biometric data, need to be addressed. Prof Wachter emphasizes the importance of discussing these privacy issues. Questions arise regarding how data will be used, who will have access to it, and the potential sharing of information with third parties. It is crucial to navigate this new technological landscape carefully to ensure that privacy rights are respected. In conclusion, IntellAct's high-tech solution to prevent flight delays shows promise in reducing turnaround times. However, experts remind us to consider the potential risks associated with monitoring systems in the airport environment. As the travel industry continues to embrace new technologies, it is crucial to have open discussions about privacy concerns. Ultimately, it is up to society to weigh the benefits of efficiency against the need to protect individual privacy.
