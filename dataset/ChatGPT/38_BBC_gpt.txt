Utah has become the first US state to pass sweeping measures aimed at protecting young people from the potential dangers of social media. The state's governor, Spencer Cox, signed two bills that will require social media companies to get parental consent for children under the age of 18 to use their apps and verify users are at least 18 years old. The new laws will also give parents access to their children's entire online accounts, block children's access to social media between 10:30 pm and 6:30 am, and prohibit social media companies from collecting a child's data or targeting them for advertising. The measures, which will take effect on March 1, 2024, are aimed at protecting young people from cyberbullying, online predators, and the harmful effects of social media addiction. While some advocacy groups have warned that parts of the legislation could put children at risk, others have praised the move as a positive step towards protecting young people in the digital age. "It's time we take steps to protect our children from the dangers of social media," said Governor Cox in a statement. "These laws will help parents and guardians keep track of what their children are doing online and protect them from potential harm.". The new laws come as concerns about the impact of social media on young people have grown in recent years. Studies have linked social media use to increased rates of depression, anxiety, and suicide among teenagers, while parents and educators have raised concerns about cyberbullying and online predators. In addition to the measures aimed at restricting access to social media, the new laws also aim to make it easier for individuals to take legal action against social media companies that fail to protect young people from harm. Under the legislation, social media companies could be held liable for damages caused by cyberbullying or online harassment. Other US states, including Arkansas, Texas, Ohio, Louisiana, and New Jersey, are also considering similar regulations aimed at protecting young people from the potential dangers of social media. However, some critics have warned that these measures could be difficult to enforce and could lead to unintended consequences. "While we support efforts to protect young people from the harmful effects of social media, we also need to be careful to avoid unintended consequences," said Rebecca Jeschke, a spokesperson for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights advocacy group. "Restricting access to social media could make it harder for young people to connect with friends and family, access important information, and express themselves online.". Despite these concerns, Governor Cox said he believes that the new laws will help parents and guardians better understand what their children are doing online and protect them from potential harm. "We know that social media can be a powerful tool for communication, but we also know that it can be dangerous if not used responsibly," he said. "These laws are a step in the right direction towards protecting our young people and ensuring that social media is used safely and responsibly.".
