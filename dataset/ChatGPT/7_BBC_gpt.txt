Clearview AI, a facial recognition company, has reportedly conducted almost 1 million searches for US police, as founder Hoan Ton-That revealed in an interview with the BBC. The company has also collected a stunning 30 billion images from various online sites - including Facebook - without users' consent. Clearview AI has been historically surrounded by controversy. It's been previously fined in Europe and Australia for privacy violations, and cybersecurity experts say that it brings up concerns related to surveillance. Matthew Guariglia, who is a representative for digital rights group Electronic Frontier Foundation, says the software adds individuals to "a perpetual police line-up‚Äù that could be accessed and used by government agencies in other countries. Facial recognition technology is a valuable tool in law enforcement, and it has been adopted by many police departments across the United States to help quickly identify suspects. Nevertheless, critics fear its use has the potential to violate civil rights, and Racial justice advocates say that it could also lead to inaccurate results, particularly for minorities and women, who have historically been underrepresented in facial recognition data sets. According to Hoan Ton-That, Clearview AI has worked with over 3,100 US law enforcement agencies, ranging from local police departments to federal agencies such as the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security. Reportedly, the software has been employed with success in numerous cases, such as helping apprehend a man who sexually abused a child with no fingerprints on the scene and identifying a New York City subway bomber in 2018. Clearview AI is one of the most powerful players in the facial recognition market; its software differs from other facial recognition tools in that it can use a single photo to identify someone, even if the image is low quality or taken from an unusual angle. The company's business strategy centers around making its technology available almost exclusively to law enforcement, local, and state government agencies, private companies, and financial institutions - a business model that other tech companies, such as Microsoft and Amazon, have rejected in favor of self-imposed restrictions and regulations. Even without a national regulatory framework, there has been a push to introduce restrictions on facial recognition technology. Last year, the city of San Francisco passed legislation that banned the use of facial recognition by law enforcement and other city agencies; various other cities and states have followed suit, imposing similar restrictions. Despite the controversies and concerns related to its technology, Ton-That claims that Clearview AI is committed to "protecting your privacy, and keeping your data safe." He adds that the company is currently in the process of hiring its first Chief Privacy Officer and will continue to improve its technology and policies as it moves forward. The revelations surrounding Clearview AI's usage in the US come at a time of extensive discussions and debate around the role of facial recognition technology and its potential to be misused in terms of surveillance and privacy violations. Earlier this year, a controversy broke out when the facial recognition startup, Clearview AI, scraped billions of images off the internet to create a comprehensive database, which it then marketed to law enforcement agencies. The company quickly became a lightning rod for privacy concerns, drawing condemnation from civil libertarians, Senate Democrats and tech watchdogs. As facial recognition software is increasingly being used by law enforcement officials around the world, it has ignited a fierce debate about government surveillance and digital privacy. Facial recognition technology is being used increasingly to identify criminal suspects and monitor people in public spaces such as stadiums and shopping centers. While proponents say it helps bolster public safety, detractors argue it can infringe on civil liberties. Facial recognition is a type of artificial intelligence that uses algorithms to match an image to a person's identity. At its core, the technology relies on biometric data, which includes unique features such as facial symmetry, eye spacing, and skin texture. But critics say facial recognition may be racially biased and that it has been used by authoritarian regimes to suppress dissent. As lawmakers and privacy advocates call for restrictions or even outright bans on facial recognition technology, several tech giants have said they won't sell their facial recognition technologies to law enforcement agencies until clearer guidelines are established. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella recently said his company would sell facial recognition technology only to government agencies that comply with human rights laws, and Amazon said it has halted police use of its facial recognition software for a year. Clearview AI's Hoan Ton-That pushed back against concerns that the company's technology could violate civil liberties, telling the Verge last year that he sees the technology as a tool that makes police officers' jobs easier. "I'm a big believer about privacy," he said. "Everyone talks about how this is an invasion of privacy [...] We're actually, in our understanding of privacy, we're doing the opposite. We are a search engine just like Google. The only difference is we're providing results that are useful for law enforcement.".
