Ispace, the Japanese space company, suffered a major blow on Thursday when it lost contact with its lunar lander moments before it was due to touch down on the Moon. The incident has left the company uncertain as to whether the Hakuto-R lander successfully made it to the lunar surface. The lander had been on a mission to conduct a series of scientific experiments, including measuring the Moon's magnetic field and carrying out a tomographic survey of the lunar subsurface. It was also carrying a commercial payload of cameras and other equipment. Despite the setback, Takeshi Hakamada, the CEO of ispace, announced that the company had already learned valuable lessons that would inform future lunar missions. "We are confident that we can overcome the challenges we have faced and continue to work towards our goal of making lunar exploration accessible to everyone," he said. Ispace is one of several private space companies around the world that are competing to develop lunar exploration technology. The firm had hoped to be the first fully private company to successfully operate a commercial lander. The company has been working on its lunar landing technology for over a decade, and had completed a successful test flight of the Hakuto-R lander in 2019. The lander was developed in collaboration with India's space agency, ISRO. Ispace had planned to conduct two lunar missions this year, with the second due to take place in November. The company has said that it will press ahead with this mission, despite the setback. The loss of contact with the lander comes just months after a Chinese lunar lander discovered subsurface water and minerals on the Moon's surface. SpaceX, the American space company owned by Elon Musk, is also developing its own lunar lander as part of its Starship program. The company has already conducted several successful test flights of its Starship spacecraft, which is designed to carry astronauts to the Moon and beyond. The successful landing of a commercial lander on the Moon is seen as a key milestone in the development of humanity's relationship with space. It will open up a range of new scientific and commercial opportunities, including asteroid mining and space tourism. Despite the setback, ispace remains confident that it will achieve its long-term goals. "We will continue to work tirelessly to ensure that humanity can explore and learn from our nearest celestial neighbour," said Hakamada.
