Six-year-old rocket company Relativity Space has decided to retire the Terran 1 rocket after just one test flight to focus on developing its next-generation Terran R rocket. This marks a shift towards building even bigger rockets, as smaller rocket companies around the world either abandon small launchers or work on larger, more economically efficient vehicles. The Terran R rocket is set to be propelled by 13 Aeon R engines on its first stage, with a single Aeon Vac engine powering the second stage. This new rocket will have a payload capacity of 23.5 metric tons to low Earth orbit and 33.5 metric tons when launched as a fully expendable vehicle. While Relativity Space has previously used 3D printing to manufacture many rocket parts, the company will now also be manufacturing parts using traditional metal-bending techniques. However, this decision to retire Terran 1 and shift focus solely to Terran R has pushed back the rocket’s launch timeline to at least 2026. Additionally, it remains unclear how much capital the company has left to see it through Terran R's first flight, as building such a large and powerful rocket will run up substantial costs. Relativity Space had originally planned for Terran 1 to serve as both a test bed for the technology that would underpin the larger Terran R model and also as a small launch vehicle for payloads of up to 1,250 kilograms. It’s hoped that by retiring Terran 1 so early in favour of Terran R, the company will be able to streamline its development process and create a more efficient and effective rocket overall. While the retirement of the Terran 1 rocket may have been surprising given its youth and potential as a small launch vehicle, Relativity Space's decision to focus on larger rockets that meet customer demand aligns with the broader market trend. Small launchers are often seen as too expensive and inefficient for many commercial applications, and as a result several smaller launch companies have shifted their focus towards building larger, more economically viable rockets. This market shift is also highlighted by aerospace giant Boeing's decision last year to abandon the development of its CST-100 Starliner capsule in favour of a larger crew module that would better meet the needs of commercial missions. And while SpaceX has previously touted the Falcon 9 as a rocket capable of both crew and cargo launches of all sizes, the company has also taken a clear preference for its larger and more powerful Falcon Heavy rocket in recent years. Relativity Space’s decision to retire the Terran 1 also leaves the company with an opportunity to more effectively focus its efforts and resources on other areas of rocket development. One key focus area is the company's use of 3D printing to manufacture rocket parts, which allows for a faster and more efficient production process. Relativity Space has said that this technology will still play a critical role in the development of Terran R, and will be used to print the engine components for the rocket's main propulsion system. However, the decision to also use traditional metal-bending techniques for certain parts suggests the company may be looking to diversify its manufacturing processes. The retirement of the Terran 1 rocket also presents an opportunity for the company to work more closely with NASA as it seeks to get Terran R qualified for launch contracts under the agency's Venture Class Launch Services program. This is a critical step for the company, as securing such contracts would give it a significant boost in revenue and allow it to invest more heavily in the development of its next-generation rocket. Overall, while the retirement of the Terran 1 rocket may have been unexpected, it represents a clear and bold shift in strategy for Relativity Space. By focusing solely on the Terran R rocket, the company is hoping to create a more efficient and effective rocket that meets customer demand for larger, more economically viable launch vehicles.
