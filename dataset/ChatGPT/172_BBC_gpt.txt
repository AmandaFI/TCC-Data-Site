Oxford, UK â€“ A 16-year-old teenager from Oxford has been accused of being one of the leaders of a notorious cyber-crime gang known as Lapsus$, which has allegedly amassed a fortune of $14 million through hacking. The teenager, who goes by the online monikers "White" and "Breachbase," has been identified as the alleged leader by rival hackers and cybersecurity researchers. However, the City of London Police have not confirmed whether the accused teenager is among the seven individuals recently arrested in connection with Lapsus$. The teenager is currently attending a special educational school in Oxford. His family, concerned about his involvement in cyber-crime, has been trying to keep him away from his computers. The boy, who is autistic, has become linked to Lapsus$, a relatively new and feared hacker gang believed to be based in South America. Lapsus$ has gained notoriety for successfully breaching major firms such as Microsoft and proudly boasting about it online. The alleged leader of Lapsus$, known as "White," was exposed by hackers on a renowned hacker website following a falling out with business partners. These hackers revealed his personal details including his name, address, social media pictures, and even a biography of his hacking career. Cybersecurity researchers have been tracking him for almost a year and have established a connection between him and Lapsus$ as well as other hacking incidents.

The investigation into the activities of Lapsus$ is still ongoing. The seven individuals arrested in connection with the gang, including the 16-year-old teenager, have been released under investigation. While the City of London Police have not confirmed the teenager's involvement, the allegations against him have raised concerns regarding the rising influence of young cyber-criminals and the need for improved cybersecurity measures.
