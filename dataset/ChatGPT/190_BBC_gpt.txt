The microchip implants that let you pay with your hand. In today's ever-advancing technological world, it seems like there's a new innovation around every corner. One such innovation that is gaining traction is the use of microchip implants for making payments. Patrick Paumen, a security guard from the Netherlands, is one of the early adopters of this technology. He recently had a contactless payment microchip implanted under his skin, allowing him to make payments by simply placing his hand near a card reader. Microchips implanted in humans are not a new concept. In fact, they have been in use since 1998, primarily for medical and identification purposes. But it's only in the past decade that they have become commercially available for everyday use. British-Polish firm Walletmor claims to be the first company to offer implantable payment chips for sale. Their chip, comprised of a tiny microchip and antenna encased in a biopolymer, uses the same technology as contactless payment systems in smartphones. Walletmor has already sold over 500 of these chips, and it seems that there is a growing interest in this technology. In a recent survey, 51% of respondents said they would consider getting an implanted payment chip. The appeal lies in the convenience it offers - no need to carry around a wallet or worry about losing a physical card. However, there are concerns that come with this new form of payment. Invasiveness and security issues are the primary concerns surrounding implanted payment chips. As technology advances, there is the potential for these chips to store more personal information, raising privacy concerns. Additionally, there are worries about the ability to track individuals with these chips. Theodora Lau, a financial technology expert, reminds us of the need to carefully weigh the benefits of convenience against the risks of privacy and security. She emphasizes the importance of finding a balance that respects individuals' rights and protects their personal data. Nada Kakabadse, a professor of policy, governance, and ethics, raises another concern - the potential for abuse and control. She questions the ethics of treating humans like pets by chipping them for payment purposes. These concerns highlight the need for careful regulation and oversight as this technology continues to evolve. On the other hand, there are those who argue that the fears surrounding implanted payment chips are unfounded. Steven Northam, founder of UK firm BioTeq, points out that these chips have been used in animals for years without any significant risks. He believes that the same holds true for humans and that the benefits of these chips outweigh any potential drawbacks. Patrick Paumen, the security guard with the implanted payment chip, considers himself a biohacker. He proudly boasts that he has a total of 32 implants, ranging from magnets to RFID chips. For him, technology is continuously evolving, and he sees these implants as a way to augment his body. He acknowledges that not everyone shares his desire to modify their bodies, and he respects that. For him, it's about personal choice and respecting each other's decisions. While the rise of implanted payment chips presents exciting possibilities for the future of payment technology, it also raises important questions about privacy, security, and ethics. As more people consider getting these chips, it's crucial for regulators and companies to address these concerns and ensure that this technology is developed and implemented responsibly. Only then can we truly embrace the benefits of this new form of payment while safeguarding our personal information and privacy.
