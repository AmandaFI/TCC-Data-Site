Big Tech played a pivotal role in driving a record surge in corporate purchases of clean energy in 2021, according to an analysis by BloombergNEF. The report reveals that corporations globally bought a record 31.1 GW of clean energy last year, accounting for over 10% of all new renewable energy capacity added worldwide. Tech giants, including Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, and Google, accounted for more than half of the power purchase agreements for clean energy. Power purchase agreements are a common tool used by companies to claim that they run their operations on 100% clean energy. However, in reality, the renewable energy may not be directly supplied to their offices and factories continuously due to insufficient renewable energy infrastructure in the grid. These agreements, known as "virtual" power purchase agreements, have been pioneered by tech companies like Google, Apple, Microsoft, and Meta. While tech companies have made significant progress in driving clean energy purchases, there is still more work to be done to clean up their operations. Google, which was once the top corporate purchaser of clean energy, now trails behind Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, and others. However, Google is charting a new course by seeking different types of renewable energy investments and contracts to match its electricity needs with clean energy on a round-the-clock basis. This ambitious strategy involves investing in new technologies, advocating for smart policies, and bringing new clean energy sources online. Microsoft has also announced a similar goal of matching its electricity use with renewable energy on a 24/7 basis. While the company still relies heavily on power purchase agreements, it is gradually changing these agreements to bring more clean energy to local grids. Meanwhile, Amazon, although not making a 24/7 clean energy matching commitment, remains the top corporate purchaser of clean energy for the second consecutive year. Interestingly, companies outside of the tech sector are showing less enthusiasm in transitioning to clean energy. Although the total renewable energy purchased by corporations increased by almost 24% compared to the previous year, the number of companies making clean energy purchases actually decreased. This indicates a slower adoption of clean energy in sectors beyond the tech industry. The prominence of tech companies in driving clean energy purchases underscores the need for stronger commitment and action from other sectors. As the demand for renewable energy continues to grow, it becomes imperative for companies across various industries to embrace clean energy sources and contribute to the global effort in combating climate change. Transitioning to clean energy not only helps reduce carbon emissions but also presents long-term economic advantages and strengthens a company's reputation as a sustainable player in the market. Encouragingly, the commitment shown by tech giants like Google, Microsoft, Meta, and Amazon sets an example for others to follow. By investing in clean energy technologies, pushing for supportive policies, and actively seeking partnerships, these companies are driving innovation and accelerating the transition to a sustainable energy future. As the year progresses, it will be crucial to monitor the progress made by tech companies and the wider corporate landscape in achieving their clean energy goals.
