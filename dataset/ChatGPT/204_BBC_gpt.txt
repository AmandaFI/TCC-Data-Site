Twitter has announced that it is limiting the content from over 300 official Russian government accounts, including those of Russian President Vladimir Putin. These accounts will no longer be recommended in timelines, notifications, or elsewhere on the site. The decision comes as Twitter has faced severe limitations in Russia since the war in Ukraine began. The move by Twitter is in response to Russia's actions in Ukraine and the country's decision to block and limit social media platforms domestically. Twitter argues that allowing Russian government officials to freely post on the platform while limiting the platform in Russia creates a harmful information imbalance. As part of its action, Twitter will no longer recommend or amplify content from the targeted Russian government accounts. Currently, Putin has two official accounts on Twitter, one in Russian and one in English, with 3.6 million and 1.7 million followers respectively. These accounts, along with official ministry and embassy profiles, as well as high-ranking Russian officials' accounts, have received criticism in the past for spreading misinformation during the Ukraine war. However, unlike tweets from Russian state-affiliated media outlets, they have not been subject to specific moderation by Twitter. Last month, a BBC investigation found evidence of further misinformation spread by these official Russian government accounts, as well as coordinated activity using multiple government accounts to drive a particular narrative, which violates Twitter's rules. The Russian Embassy in the UK's official account, for instance, falsely claimed that the bombing of a maternity hospital in Mariupol, Ukraine had been faked. Twitter's Head of Site Integrity, Yoel Roth, argues that when a government involved in armed conflict restricts access to online services within their country while using those same services to advance their positions, it creates a harmful information imbalance. Therefore, Twitter's action aims to address this issue and ensure a more balanced flow of information. The new rules, which came into force on Tuesday, initially only affect Russian government accounts. Twitter clarifies that its action is not retaliatory and that it will take action on media posted by government or state-affiliated media accounts that feature prisoners of war being subjected to ill treatment. This move follows Twitter's earlier decision to "de-amplify" Russian state media on its platform, such as Russia Today and Sputnik, on February 28. It is worth noting that while Twitter is not officially banned in Russia, the site has been severely slowed down to the point of inoperability. Twitter insists that its action is not a "tit-for-tat" policy, where blocking Twitter leads to de-amplification by Twitter, and that the enforcement will occur regardless of Twitter being blocked or not. The company believes it has found a loophole in its moderation policies regarding official Russian government accounts. Twitter's decision to limit the content from over 300 official Russian government accounts, including that of President Putin, is a significant move in response to Russia's actions in Ukraine and its restrictions on social media platforms domestically. It aims to address the harmful information imbalance created when a government involved in armed conflict limits access to online services while using those same services to advance its positions. Twitter's action sends a clear message about its commitment to combating misinformation and promoting a more balanced flow of information on its platform.
