Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana and 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, continues to advocate for smart city initiatives despite no longer holding public office. He sees smart cities as a way to address transportation issues, improve energy efficiency, and boost economic growth. Recently, the US Department of Transportation released $94m in funding for small-scale smart city projects under its Strengthening Mobility and Revolutionizing Transportation program. The funding will support initiatives such as drone delivery, smart traffic signals, and connected vehicles. Cities, states, transit agencies, and tribal governments are among those who have access to the funding to test new technologies. According to the Department of Transportation, public transportation is also a beneficiary of the funding. Several transit agencies will receive funds to improve ticketing, routing, and trip planning. The maximum award for a project is $2m, but awardees may receive additional funding if they can show their projects are generating positive results. Buttigieg, who served as Secretary of Transportation under the Biden administration, has praised the Department's funding initiative. He believes that smart cities can help communities become more resilient, sustainable, and connected. "Smart cities are not simply about technology or gadgets, they are about improving people's lives," Buttigieg said in a recent press conference. "By investing in smart city initiatives, we can create jobs, reduce congestion, and improve the quality of life for all Americans.". Buttigieg is not alone in his enthusiasm for smart cities. According to a recent report by the National League of Cities, 59% of cities are currently investing in smart city technologies. The report found that smart city initiatives were most popular among larger cities, with populations of over 500,000. Some of the most popular smart city initiatives included public Wi-Fi, smart traffic signals, and data analytics. These initiatives help cities collect data on traffic flow, energy use, and other metrics that can be used to improve city services and infrastructure. However, the report also found that many cities faced challenges when implementing smart city initiatives. These challenges included budget constraints, lack of expertise, and concerns about data privacy and security. Despite these challenges, Buttigieg remains optimistic about the potential of smart cities. During his tenure as mayor of South Bend, he was able to implement several smart city initiatives, including a real-time bus tracking system and an energy-efficient streetlamp program. "We were able to use smart city technologies to improve our transportation systems, reduce carbon emissions, and save money," Buttigieg said. "I believe that other communities can do the same with the right support and resources.". As the Department of Transportation's funding program kicks off, communities across the country will have an opportunity to test new smart city technologies and address transportation challenges. With the right support and resources, the potential for smart cities to improve people's lives is limitless.
