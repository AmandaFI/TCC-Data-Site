Planetary Secures $8 Million in Seed Funding to Scale Up Production of Alternative Proteins. Geneva, Switzerland - Planetary, a food tech company based in Geneva, has successfully raised $8 million in a seed funding round to support the expansion of its industrial-scale production facility. The funding, led by Astanor Ventures, also saw participation from investors such as XAnge, Blue Horizon, and Nucleus Capital. The company aims to assist food startups in the creation and scaling of alternative proteins using fermentation technology. Planetary primarily works with fermentation companies that utilize biomass and precision fermentation techniques to develop meat and dairy substitutes. This funding injection will enable the company to build a state-of-the-art production facility, facilitating the production and scaling of alternative proteins at a faster rate. The alternative protein sector has been gaining traction in recent years, with a rapid increase in investments. According to the Good Food Institute, the sector raised an impressive $1.7 billion in 2021, up from $600 million in 2020. This surge in funding is indicative of the growing consumer demand for sustainable and environmentally-friendly food options. Planetary intends to establish a global network of interconnected production sites across Europe, promoting the development and adoption of alternative proteins. With the construction of multiple microbial fermenters, the company aims to achieve a production capacity of between 200,000 and 500,000 liters of product. The rise of alternative proteins has been driven by advancements in fermentation technology, which allows for the creation of meat and dairy substitutes that closely resemble their animal-based counterparts in terms of taste and texture. The process involves the use of microorganisms, such as fungi or bacteria, to convert biomass into nutritious and sustainable food products. By supporting startups in the fermentation sector, Planetary is paving the way for a future where alternative proteins play a vital role in addressing global food challenges. These challenges include environmental sustainability, animal welfare, and food security. The funding round led by Astanor Ventures reflects the increasing interest from investors in supporting innovative solutions within the alternative protein industry. Astanor Ventures, a leading European impact venture firm, recognizes the potential of fermentation technology in revolutionizing the food industry. Through their investment in Planetary, they aim to propel the development and adoption of alternative proteins. Additionally, XAnge, Blue Horizon, and Nucleus Capital, among other investors, have also joined forces to finance Planetary's vision. Their contributions will aid in the creation of a robust production infrastructure capable of meeting the growing demand for alternative proteins. Planetary's ambitious plan to establish interconnected production sites across Europe will foster collaboration between fermentation companies and enable knowledge-sharing within the industry. This collaborative model is expected to accelerate innovation, drive down costs, and contribute to the mainstream adoption of alternative proteins. By scaling up production, Planetary aims to make alternative proteins more accessible and affordable to consumers, leveling the playing field with traditional meat and dairy products. The company's commitment to creating an industrial-scale facility underscores its dedication to creating a sustainable and resilient food system. The successful funding round has positioned Planetary as a leader in the alternative protein industry, with the potential to drive significant change in the way food is produced and consumed. As consumer preferences continue to evolve towards more sustainable options, the demand for alternative proteins is poised to soar in the coming years. With the support of investors, Planetary is well-positioned to build the necessary infrastructure and cultivate a global network of producers. Together, these efforts will catalyze the growth of the alternative protein sector, ensuring a more sustainable and planet-friendly future for the food industry.
