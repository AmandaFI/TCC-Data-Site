Lucid's Gravity SUV is being driven on public roads. Lucid, the electric vehicle maker, has released new images and a video of its Gravity SUV. This shows that the carmaker has entered a new phase of development, with driving tests underway on public roads in the US. The new images show a somewhat camouflaged Gravity in a dark grey matte wrap. This obscures details of its interior, including the second image of the rear. However, the images do show an un-finalised sensor on the top of the SUV. This suggests potential for autonomous technology. Reservations for the Gravity SUV will start this year. However, pricing, performance, and range details have yet to be released. This marks an exciting milestone for Lucid's development of the Gravity SUV. It also demonstrates the company's commitment to moving towards a sustainable future. Lucid's Gravity SUV is expected to be a formidable competitor to Tesla's Model X. The Model X is a popular electric SUV with autonomous capabilities. However, Lucid has indicated that the Gravity will have better range than the Model X. This will make it a more practical option for long-distance driving. The Gravity is based on Lucid's proprietary EV platform. This allows for a flexible architecture that can be adapted to different types of vehicles. Lucid has indicated that the Gravity will be an SUV that is designed to compete with the likes of the Audi e-Tron, Mercedes-Benz EQC, and Jaguar I-PACE. One of the key features of the Gravity SUV is its aerodynamics. This has been achieved through innovative design that includes a front intake and a rear diffuser. These work together to reduce drag and enable the SUV to travel further on a single charge. The Gravity is also expected to have a spacious interior that can comfortably accommodate up to seven passengers. Lucid's proprietary drivetrain technology will ensure smooth and efficient performance. The drivetrain will also be designed to cope with a wide range of weather and road conditions. Lucid's commitment to sustainability is evident from the fact that its vehicles are powered by electricity. This means that they produce zero emissions, as opposed to fossil fuel vehicles. Lucid has indicated that it is committed to ensuring that its vehicles are as eco-friendly as possible. Lucid's entry into the SUV market is an exciting development. The company has already made a name for itself with its range of electric vehicles. This latest SUV offering reinforces the company's commitment to innovation and sustainability. Lucid is a relatively new player in the automotive industry. However, it has already established itself as a serious contender. Its range of electric vehicles has been well-received by critics and consumers alike. The Gravity SUV is set to build on this success and take Lucid to the next level.
