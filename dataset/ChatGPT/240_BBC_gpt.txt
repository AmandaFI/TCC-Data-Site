New technology is being developed by engineers from Loughborough and Sheffield universities, along with engineering firm Perpetuum, to tackle the issue of hazards on railway lines, such as the infamous "leaves on the line" problem. These hazards are estimated to cost the rail industry a staggering Â£350 million per year. The system being created will utilize sensors placed near train wheels to detect and analyze small changes in how the vehicles respond to different track conditions. This data will then be fed into a computer system, which will generate a real-time map of the various biological, chemical, or physical factors on the tracks that are not easily monitored. By having access to this map, network operators will be able to quickly identify and respond to potential risks, ultimately resulting in safer and smoother services for passengers. The new technology aims to be deployed within the next five to ten years, if successful. The ultimate goal is to incorporate this technology into both passenger trains and freight locomotives, creating an up-to-date adhesion map of the entire network. This will greatly enhance the industry's ability to monitor and manage potential hazards effectively. To test the feasibility and effectiveness of their algorithms, the research team will conduct a 22-month study at Network Rail's center in Tuxford, Nottinghamshire. This facility will allow them to simulate a wide range of track conditions and hazards in a controlled environment. Dr. George Stancliffe, a researcher from Sheffield University, spoke about the potential implications of this technology. He said, "By developing a detailed understanding of the factors affecting adhesion, we can equip the industry with an innovative tool to tackle the 'leaves on the line' problem and other challenges caused by unpredictable weather conditions.". The current adhesion measurement methods often rely on manual inspections and visual observations, which can be time-consuming and unreliable. This new technology aims to revolutionize the way hazards on rails are identified, providing accurate and real-time information. Industry experts have welcomed the news of this development, highlighting the significant financial impact that delays caused by hazards on the line have on the rail sector. By effectively managing and mitigating these risks, the industry can save substantial amounts of money and improve the overall experience for passengers. While the testing phase is set to last nearly two years, expectations are high for the success of this technology. If proven effective, it could pave the way for a safer and more efficient railway network, benefiting both operators and passengers alike.
