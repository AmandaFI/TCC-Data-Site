Opera brings its free VPN to iOS to rival Apple and Googleâ€™s paid alternatives. The Norwegian company, Opera, has released an updated version of its iOS app that includes a free VPN service, making it the first browser to offer such a service across all major computing platforms. By doing so, it hopes to challenge Apple and Google's paid alternatives. Google, Opera's largest competitor, expanded its VPN tool to desktop users on Mac and PC last year, but it is only available to subscribers on its Google One paid plans. Apple offers an iCloud service that encrypts internet connections, but this is only available as part of a paid subscription. With privacy concerns at an all-time high, a VPN, or Virtual Private Network, gives users an added layer of security by redirecting their internet traffic through a remote server to hide their IP address and encrypt their data. However, VPNs can be costly, and many users opt out of subscribing to one, leaving them vulnerable. Opera's VPN, unlike its competitors, does not require a subscription, and the company does not collect personal information or data about users' browsing habits or their originating IP addresses. Therefore, it offers an excellent alternative for cash-strapped individuals who want to beef up their online security. Google and Apple's VPNs are part of their cloud services, whereas Opera's browser has the VPN built-in, allowing users to turn it on and off with a toggle switch. Furthermore, Opera's VPN does not drain the battery or slow down internet speeds. Opera's browser uses the same VPN server network as its standalone, paid VPN service, SurfEasy, which the company bought in 2015. Opera's VPN also features automatic Wi-Fi connection security, a feature that affords users the ability to instantly switch on VPN protection when connecting to unsecured, public Wi-Fi networks. It also comes with a feature that blocks intrusive ads and trackers. The company is quite vocal about privacy; it uses a zero-logs policy, meaning Opera does not store any information on what users do while using it. Its encryption standards are top-notch, with 256-bit-AES encryption, one of the toughest in the market. Although Opera may be less well-known than Google and Apple, it has a significant advantage in the VPN market by offering it for free, with no strings attached. Opera's users have grown rapidly in the last several years, helping it gain traction in the industry, it had almost 70 million active users at the beginning of 2020. While the company was sold to a Chinese consortium in 2016, it remains dedicated to user privacy, and letting individuals remain anonymous is its primary goal. The Opera VPN has individual server locations in the Americas, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific region. Other countries are routed through global servers, which can impact speeds. Opera is available for download through the App Store on iOS or via the Opera website. It's worth noting that Opera's VPN is still in its early stages, and there may be kinks to iron out. Additionally, VPN services do not guarantee complete safety on the internet. Even with a VPN, it is prudent to use common sense online, such as not visiting suspicious websites, locking devices with passcodes or biometrics, and avoiding unsecured public Wi-Fi networks. All told, Opera's effort to offer its VPN for free across all major computing platforms is welcome news for privacy-minded individuals. For those looking for an affordable VPN solution that doesn't require signing up to a long-term subscription plan, Opera's VPN could be the perfect choice.
