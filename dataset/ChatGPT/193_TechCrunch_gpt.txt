Shopify, the Canadian e-commerce giant, has launched a bill pay tool in collaboration with B2B payments firm Melio, in an attempt to become a one-stop-shop for merchants. The tool enables US-based merchants to manage their expenses and vendors via Shopify's platform, thereby saving time spent on tasks such as consolidating invoices and paying bills. Shopify declined to provide specific numbers on the number of US merchants it has. Customers of the e-commerce platform can benefit from the tool for free; however, certain payment methods may include "minimal fees." Shopify's bill pay feature is designed to provide insight into how its merchants spend and with which vendors they transact. According to a spokesperson from the firm, the new bill pay feature may prompt US merchants to undertake all of their financial services within the Shopify ecosystem. The move could consolidate the company's position within the fintech industry and improve its ability to compete with other online marketplaces like Amazon. "The feature adds value to our core offering and enables us to deepen our relationship with merchants by making us a one-stop-shop for their financial needs," said Kaz Nejatian, Vice President of Product and Merchant Services for Shopify. The platform's vendors will benefit from the tool's integration with other Shopify products, including its app store, lending program, and hardware offerings. Shopify attempted to expand further into the payments space with the launch of Shopify Payments, which enables merchants to process payments through its platform. The company's decision to collaborate with Melio suggests that it may offer foreign exchange services or other financial products to its merchants in the future. Mellio has been working towards expanding into the US market through partnerships with Intuit and QuickBooks. Shopify's reach into the payments space may also put it in a strong position to support small- to medium-sized businesses, which have been left struggling due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The bill pay feature may assist merchants to manage their finances as they attempt to survive the current economic climate. The company's move follows that of Amazon, which introduced its Bill Payments feature in India last year. The service allows users to pay electricity bills, postpaid phone bills, and broadband bills, amongst others. However, the consequences of Amazon's expansion into the payments industry have yet to be fully understood. Amazon hasn't released aggregate revenue figures for its payments services, but payments transactions originating from Amazon's marketplace are said to have reached $350bn by 2023, according to a report by Coresight Research. While Shopify has benefited significantly from the pandemic, which accelerated the pace of e-commerce adoption, the company has highlighted its desire to provide a more comprehensive set of services to its customers. Shopify's stock has risen by 142% since the start of the year, as the market has rallied in response to the pandemic. Shopify's valuation has surged to around $120bn, placing it in the same bracket as blue-chip firms such as Costco and Goldman Sachs. Shopify's acquisition of 6 River Systems, a warehouse automation and robotics firm, further enhanced its status as an e-commerce giant. The acquisition enabled Shopify's customers to access automated warehousing and fulfillment facilities as part of their e-commerce solutions. Shopify has also been active in developing a gaming platform for merchants. The platform allows vendors to build experiences that feature their products and allows users to play games for prizes. The move is part of Shopify's broader strategy to expand the range of products it offers. Shopify's move into the fintech industry is likely to be welcomed by its merchants, who have to work with numerous financial services platforms to manage their finances.
