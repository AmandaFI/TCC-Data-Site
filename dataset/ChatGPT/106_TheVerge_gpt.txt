Swiss company Climeworks is set to expand its direct air capture (DAC) technology across the US, marking its first partnership with an oil and gas company. Climeworks has applied for a share of $3.5bn in grants from the US Department of Energy (DOE) in collaboration with other firms. Its main target areas are California, North Dakota and Louisiana, states which have been pushing decarbonization policies and have become a destination of choice for carbon removal projects. . The recent introduction of two major pieces of legislation has made the US a particularly attractive place to deploy carbon removal technologies. The Inflation Reduction Act has introduced a tax credit worth up to $50 per metric tonne of carbon dioxide (CO2) captured, while the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law authorises over $8bn in funding towards carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS). . Despite its previous reluctance to work with companies from the fossil fuel industry, Climeworks’ decision reflects the reality of the US market. The debate about climate change is heavily influenced by entrenched interests in the traditional energy sector, and many climate technology startups have struggled to find funding. The CCUS technology is expected to be critical in US’ efforts to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, as it can remove up to 90% of CO2 from the atmosphere. . Climeworks is a pioneer in DAC technology, which uses large fans to capture CO2 from the air. The company's founders founded Climeworks in 2009, and since then, it has raised more than $113m in funding from venture capitalists, individual investors and institutional funds. The company has already installed more than 30 carbon capture devices in six countries, including Switzerland, Germany, Italy, Iceland, Canada, and Norway. The captured CO2 is processed either as a raw material for industrial processes or sequestered underground. . However, the technology's novelty and high costs have proved to be a hurdle in its implementation. Climeworks charges between $600 and $1,000 per tonne of carbon dioxide, making its solution twenty times more expensive than traditional carbon offsets. The grants from the US Department of Energy will allow the company to bring the cost of carbon capture down by scaling its operations. . Climeworks is partnering with a group of companies, including oil and gas firms, to widen its customer base in the US. It has partnered with oilfield services provider Schlumberger, the world's largest oilfield services company, and engineering group Linde to deliver its DAC solution to customers. . Schlumberger has been expanding its environmental business, and its agreement with Climeworks makes it the first oilfield services provider to enter the growing market for carbon capture and storage projects. Linde, on the other hand, plans to provide the necessary technical and logistical support to deploy DAC solutions to potential customers. . CEO Jan Wurzbacher emphasised that the company wants to ensure the technology serves a broader societal purpose beyond satisfying carbon offset needs. However, there is a risk that the company will be associated with entrenched carbon spewers in the fossil fuel industry, which could result in a tide of criticism from the climate action sector. . The US carbon removal market is still in its infancy. A recent report by Global CCS Institute, a climate change focused think-tank, shows a marked increase in carbon capture projects since 2019. At present, 28 carbon capture projects are operational, and more than 40 additional projects are in development, with a combined capture capacity of 139 million tonnes per year. . To bring more projects to fruition, the US Department of Energy has awarded $110m in funding to 6 carbon capture projects. The projects range from a small pilot-scale bioenergy facility in New Hampshire to large-scale transportation and storage in the Gulf of Mexico. . Carbon capture and removal technologies offer another route for the US to mitigate its greenhouse gas emissions, along with replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy sources. However, critics say that carbon capture technology is likely only a stopgap solution and a way for the fossil fuel industry to continue operating. . As the world grapples with an energy transition, carbon capture and removal technologies have become necessary to achieve climate goals. With governments offering incentives, such as tax credits and grants, to promote their deployment, the technology is likely to mature further and become more cost-effective.
