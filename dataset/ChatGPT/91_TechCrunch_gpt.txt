After stints at SpaceX, three brothers want to build spacecraft powered by moon water. Argo Space Corporation, a startup founded by three SpaceX veterans, is developing a space transportation network that uses reusable spacecraft propelled by water harvested from the moon. The company's first spacecraft, the Argonaut, will be reusable and refuelable, with the ability to perform transfers beyond low Earth orbit. Argo plans to harvest and store lunar water for fuel, using a water plasma thruster as its propulsion system. Investors have so far put $2m into the project. Argo aims to be processing regolith on the moon, to make water, in the late 2020s. The three brothers, Andreas, Jorge, and Eduardo von der Heyden, left SpaceX in search of a new challenge. They saw the potential of lunar water as a sustainable source of fuel for space transportation and founded Argo Space Corporation to make it a reality. "Lunar water is one of the most valuable resources in the solar system," said Andreas von der Heyden, Argo's CEO. "It unlocks the potential for long-term, sustainable space exploration. Using it as fuel enables us to dramatically reduce the cost and complexity of missions beyond low Earth orbit.". The Argonaut, Argo's first spacecraft, will be 65 meters long, with a maximum diameter of 10 meters, and a dry mass of 50 tonnes. It will have a modular design, allowing for different payloads and mission types. The spacecraft will be powered by a water plasma thruster, which uses electricity to ionize water into a plasma that propels the spacecraft forward. This technology is more efficient than chemical rockets and can carry more fuel for longer journeys. "Water plasma thrusters are the future of space propulsion," said Jorge von der Heyden, Argo's CTO. "They offer significant advantages over traditional chemical rockets, such as high specific impulse, which means more thrust per unit of fuel.". Argo plans to obtain lunar water by harvesting and processing regolith, the loose material on the moon's surface. The company's engineers are developing a system that uses high-pressure water jets to excavate regolith and extract water molecules. Argo will then store the water in tanks on the moon and use it to refuel spacecraft. The company aims to establish a base on the moon in the late 2020s to carry out this process on a large scale. "The challenge of harvesting and processing lunar water is significant, but it's a challenge that we're excited to tackle," said Eduardo von der Heyden, Argo's COO. "The potential reward is immense, not just for Argo, but for the entire space industry.". Investors are showing confidence in Argo's vision, with $2m raised so far. The company plans to use this funding to build prototypes of the Argonaut and to develop its regolith harvesting and processing technology. "We believe that Argo's innovative approach to space transportation has the potential to revolutionize the industry," said Marcia Thompson, an investor in Argo. "Their vision of using lunar water as fuel is both bold and practical, and we're excited to see where it takes them.". Argo's goal is to reduce the cost and complexity of space transportation, making it more accessible for commercial and scientific purposes. The company plans to offer launch services for payloads of up to 30 tonnes, as well as transportation for human missions beyond low Earth orbit. "The potential applications of our technology are vast," said Andreas von der Heyden. "From establishing a permanent human presence on the moon to exploring the outer planets and asteroids, there's no limit to what we can achieve.". Argo Space Corporation is on a mission to revolutionize space transportation with sustainable fuel from the moon. The von der Heyden brothers are confident that their innovative technology will change the way we explore the cosmos, and investors are betting on their success.
