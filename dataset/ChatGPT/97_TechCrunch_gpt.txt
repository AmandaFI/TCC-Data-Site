Track the Right Metrics to Improve Your Developers' Work Experience. The tech industry has seen a shift away from prioritizing employees in recent months, with layoffs and economic uncertainty having a detrimental effect on morale and well-being. While digital health tools and mental health days can provide short-term relief, they do not address the root causes of dissatisfaction among software engineers. To address this issue, companies should focus on developer experience (DX), including how developers feel about their work on a daily basis, which is influenced by the tools and processes they use. Engineering leaders can monitor engineer satisfaction and performance to identify factors harming their experience and embrace new metrics to respond to them. The SPACE system is a metric that provides a more holistic approach to improving developer experience by addressing both the technical and emotional aspects of software engineering. This system encompasses DORA metrics, which are commonly used to measure software engineering performance, while also considering the human aspect of engineers' work. Improving DX can lead to better business results, as happy and engaged engineers are more productive and innovative. However, tracking and improving DX is a complex task, as it involves addressing technical and emotional factors that impact engineers' daily work experience. As Kyle Jepsen, Lead Senior Engineer for Continuous Delivery at Fannie Mae, explains: "Engineers are unique, and their experiences are highly subjective. Some engineers may prefer certain tools or enjoy working in a particular environment, while others may not. It's vital to collect enough data and feedback to gain a clear understanding of what makes engineers happy and productive, and build on that.". Tracking DX metrics can help engineering leaders identify issues that negatively impact engineers' experience, such as lack of autonomy and decision-making power, poor communication between teams, inadequate training and support, and long hours. Addressing these factors can result in a happier, more productive workforce, and ultimately, better business outcomes. One company that has successfully implemented a DX metric system is Google. The company uses the Googlegeist survey to gather anonymous feedback from its employees, including software engineers. This feedback is then used to identify areas where the company can improve, such as increasing autonomy and improving communication between teams. Another metric that can be used to measure DX is the employee net promoter score (eNPS). This score reflects the likelihood that an employee would recommend their workplace to others. High eNPS scores indicate a positive work environment and high levels of job satisfaction. In addition to traditional metrics, engineering leaders can also use the SPACE (Satisfaction, Performance, Autonomy, Communication, and Education) system to track and improve DX. This system includes metrics for job satisfaction, performance, autonomy, communication, and education. The Satisfaction metric measures how happy engineers are with their work and overall experience at the company. Performance measures how well engineers are meeting their goals and contributing to the company's success. Autonomy measures how much control and decision-making power engineers have over their work. Communication measures how well teams are communicating with one another and with other departments. Education measures how well the company is supporting the engineers' professional development and growth. Using the SPACE system can provide engineering leaders with a more holistic view of their employees' experience and identify areas for improvement. It also helps to shift the focus away from solely technical metrics, such as lines of code or bug fixes, and prioritizes the well-being of software engineers. As Jepsen explains: "By embracing more human-focused metrics, we can shape a better work environment for our engineers, one that is more sustainable and rewarding. This will ultimately result in better business outcomes as happy and engaged engineers are more productive and innovative.". In conclusion, tracking DX metrics, such as the SPACE system, can lead to a happier, more engaged workforce and better business outcomes. As the tech industry becomes more competitive and uncertain, prioritizing employee well-being and experience is crucial for attracting and retaining top talent and ensuring long-term success.
