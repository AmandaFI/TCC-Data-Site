Amazon has confirmed that UK-based online book retailer Book Depository will be closing down after almost two decades in business. The news comes amid thousands of job cuts at the US tech giant, which has experienced a slowdown in sales after enjoying increased business during the pandemic. Book Depository customers can continue to order books until the company ceases operations on 26 April. Thousands of Book Depository's global customers, including bestselling authors, have reacted with sadness over the announcement. The website was known for its extensive catalogue of books, as well as its free global shipping. Customers appreciated the site's easy-to-use interface and wide range of books, making it a go-to destination for book lovers worldwide. The closure of Book Depository is part of Amazon's cost-saving measures, which includes significant changes to its book business such as halting magazine and newspaper subscriptions on e-book device Kindle. "We are sad to announce that Book Depository will be closing down on 26 April. We are confident that the large number of books we have sold throughout the years have brought our customers tremendous joy and enrichment. Our focus now is on ensuring a smooth transition and making sure that orders are fulfilled until our last day of operations," said Book Depository in a statement. The announcement has been met with disappointment from the publishing industry with many questioning why Amazon would choose to shut down such a popular site. Book Depository was known for its competitive pricing and extensive catalogue of titles. It is not clear how many staff members will be affected by the closure, although it is expected that a small team of employees will continue to work until all orders are fulfilled. The future of Book Depository's inventory is also unclear. It is reported that Amazon may transfer the remaining stock to its own warehouses. Amazon acquired Book Depository in 2011 for an undisclosed sum, with the aim of extending its reach in the online book retail market. The site's free global shipping made it an attractive proposition for customers worldwide, and it quickly became a go-to destination for book lovers. The news of Book Depository's closure follows a difficult year for the publishing industry, which has been hit hard by the pandemic. Bookstores around the world have been forced to close their doors, and the closure of Book Depository is yet another blow to the industry. Despite the closure of Book Depository, Amazon remains a major player in the book retail industry. The tech giant's market share of e-book sales is reported to be over 80%, and it remains one of the largest book retailers in the world. However, the move to close Book Depository shows that Amazon is not immune to the impact of the pandemic, and that it is taking steps to cut costs in response.
