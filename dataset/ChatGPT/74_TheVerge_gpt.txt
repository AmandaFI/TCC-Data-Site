Google has announced that it will be shutting down support for its home security system, the Nest Secure, and the Dropcam on April 8, 2024. The move comes as Google prepares to launch its new Google Home app, which will replace the aging Nest app. The company has been winding down its legacy Works with Nest connections as it shifts its focus to supporting Google Assistant and the upcoming app. The Nest Secure was originally launched in 2017, but Google cancelled the product last year after making a strategic investment in ADT. While the company has not yet confirmed what will replace the Nest Secure, it is expected that ADT's Self Setup system will be compatible with Google Home. The move could help differentiate Google's platform from its competitors, as ADT is a well-known name in home security and could lend the tech giant added legitimacy in that space. Google has said that existing Dropcam cameras will continue to function until the service is discontinued in 2024. However, the company is encouraging users to switch to the newer Nest Cameras, which offer improved functionality and better integration with Google Assistant. To sweeten the deal, Google is offering subscribers to the Nest Aware service free wired Nest Cameras in exchange for their Dropcams. Non-subscribers can receive 50% off coupons for Nest Cameras. The announcement has come as a surprise to some users, who had hoped that Google would continue to support the Nest Secure and Dropcam for the long term. However, the move is seen as part of a broader effort by the company to streamline its product lines and focus on its core competencies. Google has been working to integrate all of its smart home devices into a cohesive ecosystem, and the new Google Home app is expected to be a key part of that strategy. The decision to invest in ADT has been seen as a shrewd move by Google, as the home security market is seen as a lucrative growth area. With more people spending time at home due to the coronavirus pandemic, interest in home security systems has been on the rise. According to a recent report by Research and Markets, the global home security market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 8.3% between 2020 and 2027, driven by a growing awareness of the need for home security and an increase in smart home adoption. By partnering with ADT, Google is positioning itself to capture a larger share of that market. ADT has a well-established reputation in the home security space, and its Self Setup system is likely to be a popular choice for consumers who are looking for a simple and affordable solution. By integrating that system with Google Home, the company could create a powerful tool that is both easy to use and effective at protecting homes. Overall, the decision to end support for the Nest Secure and Dropcam is part of a larger strategy by Google to streamline its product lines and focus on its core competencies. By investing in ADT and building out its smart home ecosystem, the company is positioning itself for growth in the home security market and beyond. While some users may be disappointed by the news, the move is likely to be welcomed by those who are looking for a more integrated and streamlined smart home experience. With the new Google Home app set to launch soon, it will be interesting to see how the company's vision for the future of the smart home unfolds.
