Device-as-a-service startup Fleet is making waves in the tech industry with its innovative approach to device leasing. In a bid to help small and very small businesses access technology and furniture equipment, the French startup is expanding beyond laptop leasing. Fleet's leasing model, which allows companies to rent MacBooks instead of buying them, has proven to be a hit with businesses looking to turn capital expenditures into predictable operating expenditures. The company has already deployed nearly 10,000 devices mainly through long-term leasing contracts, with transparent, automated pricing that eliminates hidden costs. Unlike other leasing companies, Fleet does not have a warehouse or large credit line but works with financial partners when clients order devices. This allows the startup to keep costs low and offer better pricing to businesses. To expand its offerings, Fleet is now leasing other technology equipment and furniture for small and very small companies who struggle to access credit to purchase such items outright. This will allow these businesses to access the latest technology without the need for large upfront capital. "We want to provide small businesses with the same level of access to technology as larger companies. Our aim is to democratize the world of technology with transparent and accessible leasing services," said Brieuc Oger, co-founder of Fleet. As some of Fleet's customers' leases come to an end, the company has launched a donation program for any unused devices. This program will allow companies to donate their unused devices to schools and other organizations that need them. "We believe that every device should be put to good use and this program is a great way to ensure that devices are used and not left to collect dust in storage," added Oger. Fleet's expansion into leasing technology equipment and furniture is expected to be a game-changer for small businesses struggling to access credit. The company's transparent pricing, as well as its donation program, highlights its commitment to helping small businesses grow. "With the pandemic and the economic crisis, it has become increasingly difficult for small businesses to access credit. Fleet's leasing model provides an alternative that not only helps businesses access technology and equipment but also allows them to manage their cash flow more effectively," said Christine Casanova, a small business owner. Fleet's innovative approach to device leasing has attracted attention from investors and industry experts alike. The startup was recently named as one of the Top 100 European tech startups by online tech publication, Tech.eu. "Fleet is a pioneer in the device leasing industry and its expansion into leasing technology equipment and furniture is set to disrupt the market. With its transparent pricing and donation program, Fleet is not only providing a service but also making a positive impact on society," said Casanova. With small businesses becoming the lifeblood of many economies, Fleet's expansion strategy is expected to drive growth by enabling small businesses to access the technology and equipment they need to grow and compete with larger companies.
