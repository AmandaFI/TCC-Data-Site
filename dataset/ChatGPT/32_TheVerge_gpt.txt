Google has cut off third-party smart displays from receiving software updates, with the discontinuation of updates for devices including Lenovo Smart Display, JBL Link View, and LG Xboom AI ThinQ WK9 Smart Display. While the move doesn't affect the existing functionality of the displays, it does signal Google's shift away from older Assistant technology and toward generative AI, such as its Bard project. The company is also investing less in Assistant products for other third-party devices like smart speakers and smartwatches. Google has been focusing on its generative AI technology, including its recently unveiled language-optimizing model, BERT. Bard, its generative conversational AI, is another such development, aimed at creating open-domain, human-like, natural conversations. To bolster its efforts in this direction, Google has reportedly discontinued software updates for its third-party smart displays. These include popular devices such as the Lenovo Smart Display, JBL Link View, and LG Xboom AI ThinQ WK9 Smart Display. While the existing devices will continue to function, the lack of updates means they will not benefit from any new features or security enhancements that Google may develop for the Assistant. The Google Assistant team's engineering vice president, Amar Subramanya, will now lead the Bard team. This suggests that Google is placing more emphasis on generative AI, as opposed to traditional AI that is based on pre-defined rules. Reports suggest that Google is also investing less in Assistant products for other third-party devices, such as smart home speakers and smartwatches. However, this does not mean that the company is abandoning these products altogether. Rather, it is focusing on bringing Assistant to more Google-branded devices. Google has faced criticism in the past for the fragmentation of its Assistant platform, which has resulted in some devices being left behind when it comes to updates. This latest move is likely aimed at consolidating Google's Assistant platform by removing older devices from the equation. "The Assistant is at the core of Google's efforts to deliver a seamless experience across devices and services," said a Google spokesperson. "We're always exploring new ways to make the Assistant more helpful and accessible to people everywhere, and we look forward to continuing to expand its capabilities.". Despite the move away from traditional Assistant technology, the platform remains a central part of Google's strategy for dominating the smart home market. According to a recent report by Strategy Analytics, Google currently ranks third behind Amazon and Alibaba in the global smart speaker market, but the search giant is expected to continue gaining ground in the years to come. The report suggests that the increasing popularity of Google's Assistant, combined with the growing demand for smart home devices, will help the company to gain market share in the smart speaker space. By 2025, Google is expected to have a 30% share of the global market. Google also has its sights set on other smart home devices beyond smart speakers. The company is reportedly working on a new smart home device known as "Nest Hub Max," which will serve as a hub for controlling all kinds of smart home devices. The device is expected to come with a 10-inch display, HD camera, and Google's Assistant built in. In summary, Google has cut off updates for third-party smart displays including Lenovo Smart Display, JBL Link View, and LG Xboom AI ThinQ WK9 Smart Display as it shifts focus to generative AI technology, such as Bard. This move doesn't affect existing device functionality, but it does show Google's decreased investment in traditional Assistant products for third-party smart home speakers and smartwatches. Despite this shift, Google's Assistant remains a central part of its smart home strategy, with the company expected to gain market share in the space over the next few years.
