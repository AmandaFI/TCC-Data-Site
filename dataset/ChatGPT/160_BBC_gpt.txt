Title: Dairy Giant Arla Warns of Supply Issues Unless Farmers are Paid More. Dairy company Arla Foods has sounded the alarm, warning that milk supplies in the UK could be put at risk unless farmers are paid a higher price for their produce. The managing director of Arla Foods, Ash Amirahmadi, highlighted the struggles faced by farmers in covering their expenses, primarily due to escalating feed, fuel, and fertilizer costs. In response to these challenges, farmers are producing less milk, resulting in a 2% decrease in February and a further 4% decrease in March. Amirahmadi emphasized the critical need for supermarkets to pay farmers more, asserting that the current prices are unsustainable. Arla Foods, the largest dairy company in the UK, has a network of 2,100 dairy farmers in the country and 8,950 across Europe. These farmers are grappling with a staggering 36% increase in costs, which has pushed many of them to contemplate scaling back production if the economic situation fails to improve. Despite the price of milk in stores being 7% lower than it was a decade ago, this reduction has not been reflected in the prices received by farmers. To combat these challenges, Arla Foods sees an opportunity in the increasing global demand for dairy and is considering exporting fresh British milk for processing at its European facilities. The processed milk would then be sold on international markets, presenting a potential avenue for UK farmers to expand their income. Amirahmadi stressed that the liquid milk market in the UK has failed to deliver for farmers, necessitating tough decisions to be made in the next five years. These decisions are crucial to ensure that farmers can cover their costs and invest in sustainability measures aimed at reducing on-farm emissions. The warning from Arla Foods comes at a time when dairy farming in the UK is already facing significant challenges. Volatile weather patterns and increased competition from other countries have serious implications for the industry's stability. Furthermore, the uncertainties surrounding Brexit have left the sector in a state of apprehension, with concerns over tariffs and access to export markets. Representatives from the farming industry have echoed Arla Foods' concerns and are calling for urgent action. The National Farmers' Union (NFU) has emphasized the need for fairer prices in the supply chain, which would provide farmers with a sustainable income that could safeguard the future of dairy farming in the UK. The NFU also stressed the importance of ensuring a level playing field for British farmers, eliminating unfair competition from imported products produced to lower standards. In response to the challenges faced by dairy farmers, the UK government has launched a consultation on fairer contract terms between farmers and processors. The consultation aims to address the existing power imbalances in the supply chain and ensure fairer treatment for farmers. The government has also reiterated its commitment to supporting the agricultural sector throughout the Brexit transition and beyond. As the dairy industry grapples with the possibility of supply issues, it is vital that all stakeholders work together to find a sustainable solution. Paying farmers a fairer price for their milk should be a priority for supermarkets and consumers alike, to allow farmers to cover their costs, invest in the future, and ensure the availability of fresh and high-quality milk for consumers.
