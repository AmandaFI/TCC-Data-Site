Social media: How (some) use can be good for teenagers. New research has shed light on how social media can positively impact the mental health and wellbeing of teenagers, as long as they are using the platforms appropriately and talking to close friends they already know in real life. The study, conducted by Cardiff University's public health body Decipher, found that engaging in online conversations with close friends can boost wellbeing, whereas conversations with strangers can increase feelings of depression. The research is particularly relevant to Wales, where a recent survey revealed that some teenagers experienced adverse mental health symptoms during the pandemic. This study provides insight into how parents can support their children's online social interactions and help promote healthy online habits. In the study, researchers analyzed the online habits of over a thousand teenagers aged 13 to 15 from across the UK. The participants completed questionnaires about their social media use, mental health, and wellbeing. The results showed that teenagers who only spoke to people online had notably poorer wellbeing than those who spoke to close friends they already knew in real life. Moreover, those who regularly chatted with strangers online reported more depressive symptoms. Importantly, the study found that online conversations with close friends were not linked to any negative mental health effects. The study's lead author, Dr. Heather Woods, said: "Our research shows that socializing online can be valuable for teenagers' mental health and wellbeing. The key is that teens should be talking to people they already know and trust, rather than strangers online.". The findings underscore the importance of parental involvement in guiding their children's use of social media. Parents can play a significant role in helping their teenagers identify the benefits of social media and moderate their use. Dr. Woods added that "Parents can help their kids develop a balanced approach to social media by encouraging them to use it in moderation and monitoring their behavior online.". Indeed, social media has been a lifeline for many teenagers during the pandemic, helping them stay connected to their friends and providing a virtual space for social interaction. However, the increased use of online platforms has also brought new challenges, such as exposure to fake news, online bullying, and harmful content. Louise Howard, a professor of women's mental health at King's College London, described the study's findings as "really important." She said the research provides valuable guidance for parents and policymakers on how to support teenagers' mental health in an increasingly digital world. "It highlights the importance of making sure that adolescents understand the risks and benefits of social media use," she added. So, what can parents do to help promote healthy online habits? The study's authors suggest several strategies to guide teenagers' social media use:. 1. Encourage teenagers to chat with close friends they already know and trust in real life. 2. Monitor your child's social media use and encourage them to use it in moderation. 3. Help your child develop critical thinking skills to identify fake news and harmful content online. 4. Teach your child how to handle online bullying and harassment. 5. Set clear boundaries for social media use, such as no phones at the dinner table or no social media after a certain time of day. The study's findings provide a timely reminder of the important role parents can play in helping their children navigate the pitfalls of social media and promoting healthy online habits. With the pandemic continuing to disrupt daily life, social media will undoubtedly remain a crucial tool for teenagers to stay connected with their peers. By following the advice of the study's authors, parents can help ensure that their children are using social media in a positive and beneficial way.
