Mental Health Helpline Ends Data-Sharing Relationship. A mental health text helpline, Crisis Text Line (CTL), has announced the termination of its data-sharing agreement with an AI customer support business, Loris.ai, following backlash and criticism from its community. Loris.ai had been utilizing anonymized data from CTL to develop AI systems that assist customer service agents in understanding the sentiment of chats. However, a CTL board member recently admitted on Twitter that they had made a mistake in accepting this partnership. This announcement came after concerns were raised by the community regarding the potential misuse and privacy implications of sharing sensitive mental health data. In response to these concerns, CTL decided to sever ties with Loris and reassured a similar helpline in the UK that their data was not shared with the AI customer support business. CTL confirmed to the BBC that the data-sharing relationship with Loris was officially terminated on January 31st. The helpline has also requested the deletion of its data, clarifying that Loris had not accessed any information since the beginning of 2020. The recent attention on CTL's data-sharing practices originated from a report by Politico, where Loris claimed that its AI chat solution helped customer service representatives understand sentiment and provide appropriate responses. Loris further stated that its AI had evolved to incorporate additional data from businesses, including e-commerce data. On the other hand, CTL emphasized that any data shared with Loris was completely anonymized and did not include any personally identifiable information. The helpline maintained that it had been transparent with its users about data sharing through its terms of service and privacy policies. However, some experts have voiced concerns about whether individuals in a mental health crisis can truly provide meaningful consent for the sharing of their data. Internal discussions within CTL have also cast doubts on the wisdom of partnering with Loris.ai. A board member of CTL openly admitted that they were mistaken in accepting the data-sharing agreement with the AI customer support business. The termination of the data-sharing relationship highlights the growing concerns surrounding the use and privacy of sensitive data, particularly in the mental health field. It has spurred discussions about the importance of ethical data practices and the informed consent of individuals seeking mental health support. CTL's decision to cut ties with Loris signifies its commitment to addressing these concerns and protecting the privacy of its users. Moving forward, CTL may face the challenge of rebuilding trust in its data practices and ensuring that the data of those seeking mental health support remains safe and confidential.
