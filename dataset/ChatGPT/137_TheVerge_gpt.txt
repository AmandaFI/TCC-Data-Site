In a shocking turn of events, BuzzFeed News, the Pulitzer Prize-winning news arm of BuzzFeed.com, is being shut down. This news comes as part of a new wave of layoffs at the company that will reduce the workforce by about 15%. BuzzFeed CEO, Jonah Peretti, announced that the company can no longer continue to fund BuzzFeed News as a standalone organization and will instead focus on HuffPost, which it acquired in 2020, as the news brand because it is "profitable with a loyal direct front page audience.". The decision to shut down BuzzFeed News comes after Peretti made the difficult choice to over-invest in the news arm because he loved its work and mission. However, he said platforms wouldn’t provide the distribution or financial support required to support premium free journalism purpose-built for social media. BuzzFeed has been struggling for some time as a result of platform changes, and Peretti highlighted a number of challenges that the company has faced including a pandemic, a fading SPAC market, a tech recession, a tough economy, a declining stock market, decelerating digital advertising, and ongoing audience and platform shifts. The company has been experimenting with AI-generated articles, including quizzes and travel guides, and laid off 12% of its staff in December. However, these efforts have not been enough to save BuzzFeed News. The closure of BuzzFeed News is a huge blow to the world of journalism, given its reputation for quality reporting and groundbreaking investigations. The news outlet won its first Pulitzer Prize in 2018 for a series of reports exposing a pattern of sexual misconduct and harassment by powerful men in Hollywood, which is credited with helping spark the #MeToo movement. BuzzFeed has stated that it plans to open “a number of select roles” for BuzzFeed News staffers, but it remains unclear what those roles will be and how many employees will be affected. The closure of BuzzFeed News is yet another example of the precarious state of digital media, which has been hit hard by platform changes and the ongoing shift in advertising dollars from traditional media to social media. It is a reminder that quality journalism is not immune to financial pressures and that the future of the industry is far from certain.
